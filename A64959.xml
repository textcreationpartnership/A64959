         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>'TIs not at all improper to add a Treatiſe of the Day of Grace, to a Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Converſion. This is the only time wherein he that turns will be accepted: Oh therefore receive not the Grace of God in vain. Though the ſinner by his iniquity is removed far away from God, the Gulph not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is not yet fixed. We are caſt out by Nature in a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try indeed, but this Country is not Hell, though juſt upon the borders of Hell: a return is poſſible unto our Fathers houſe; and upon our return how joyfully ſhall we be embraced!</p>
            <p>One principal reaſon why Time is ſo exceeding precious, is, becauſe it contains the Day of Grace. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:43094:3"/> time, though ſo very ſhort, is of greater value then an whole Eternity hereafter; for then mercy will be out of reach, and Reprobates unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably concluded in ſin, and under the heavy load of divine vengeance and indignation. This is the Day of thy gracious viſitation: Waſte it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in doing nothing, or which is worſe, in doing wickedly; for there is another day a coming, which will be a day of darkneſs and of gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a day of diſtreſs and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if Grace and Salvation be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He time was now approaching in which our Lord was to make his Soul an offering for ſin, and to teſtifie his love to his Sheep, by laying down his life, to redeem theirs from death, which by going aſtray they had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is appointed the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43094:4"/> Stage, on which Chriſt was to act the greateſt part, both of ſorrow and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Well might he cry out, <hi>Behold ye that paſs by; Was ever Grief,</hi> and <hi>Was ever Love like Mine?</hi> Unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he comes moſt willingly, though he ſoreſaw the Croſs and ſhame. The Head was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſuffer himſelf, that hereby the ſufferings of the Members might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. And according as it was foretold by the Prophet, his approach is not with outward pomp and ſplendour; but he is meek and lowly, riding upon an Aſſes Foal. Thus he that thought it not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God, made himſelf of no reputation, and humbled himſelf to this end, that we might be raiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>
            <p>When he was juſt at the deſcent of the Mount of <hi>Olives, the whole multitude of the diſciples began to rejoyce, and to praiſe God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had ſeen,</hi> v. 37. They cry <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, and bleſs the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, ſaying, Peace in heaven and glory in the higheſt, v.</hi> 38. Even through
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43094:4"/> the darkeſt cloud of Chriſts Humiliation, ſome beams and rayes of this Sun of Righteouſneſs, of this Lord of glory, did break forth. The Phariſees are offended at the Diſciples acclamations, and <hi>deſire Jeſus to rebuke them, v.</hi> 39. Unto which unreaſonable requeſt of theirs he makes this reply, <hi>That if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out, v.</hi> 40. As if he had ſaid, My Perſon, my Doctrine, my Actions, my Wonders are ſo evident, that they who are not as ſtupid as the ſtoues themſelves muſt needs be convinced.</p>
            <p>At laſt he comes within view of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the ſight of this faithleſs, ungrateful and obſtinate City, where ſo many Prophets had been kill'd, and which now it ſelf was ſo near to deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, raiſes a ſorrow in his ſacred breaſt, ſo that in the midſt of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples triumph he burſts out into tears, ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words expreſs how our Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43094:5"/> was affected towards <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. His commiſeration is very great, and 'tis joyned with a kind of exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or upbraiding of them: he pitties their ſad eſtate, and upbraids their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and folly, in not minding the things which would have conduced to their peace and welfare.</p>
            <p>The text may be thus divided.</p>

            <p>I ſhall illuſtrate the words of the Text by this enſuing Commentary upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City.</hi> The nearneſs of a miſerable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject does affect the ſight and heart. And as with his eyes he ſaw the City, ſo by the eyes of Propheſie he ſaw the City beſieged, the enemy caſting a trench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and keeping it in on every ſide; he foreſaw how it would be laid even with the ground by <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, and not ſo much as one ſtone left upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he wept over it.</hi> Theſe tears ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth of his humane nature, and how (iniquity excepted) he was in all things made like unto his brethren. Our Lord could hunger, and groan, and weep, and dye, but ſin indeed he could not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. It was the deſire of Chriſt to execute th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> office which his Father had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43094:6"/> put him in, which was to be a Gatherer and a Saviour of the loſt Sheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But when he perceived thoſe Sheep transformed into Wolves, ready to devour their own Shepherd, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily reſolved to periſh, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſalvation which he brought them, 'tis no wonder if he did not hold his tears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saying, If thou hadſt known, even thou.</hi> There is a mixture of grief and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt, at the ignorance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of miſerable <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and this made his ſpeech to be abrupt and imperfect. <hi>Calvin</hi> tranſlates <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>O ſi cognoviſſes!</hi> Our Lord wiſhes that they had known what ſo highly and nearly concerned them. But 'tis plainly implied that they <hi>knew not:</hi> and this is that of which the Prophet long ago complained, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>The Ox knows his owner, and the Aſs his Maſters crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my people do not conſider.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thou;</hi> this is very emphatical. As if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, O thou <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who haſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many means and mercies, and haſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43094:6"/> ſlighted and abuſed them all, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all former folly and unkindneſs to God, to thy ſelf, I wiſh that <hi>even thou,</hi> wouldſt at laſt have open'd thy eyes and ears, and become wiſe unto thy own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At leaſt in this thy day.</hi> That was a day of ſpecial viſitation. God who at ſundry times and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, in that day ſpake unto them by his Son. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many Meſſengers and Servant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This was <hi>their</hi> day, a time in which they might have been accepted, a day in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſalvation was brought near to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The things which belong unto thy peace!</hi> Peace (according to the Hebrew phraſe) does imply all the parts of happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſs, the principal whereof does certainly lie in being reconciled to, and enjoying God. But the way of peace and reconciliation, namely, Juſtification by faith in Jeſus, they knew not. An humbled Meſſiah,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43094:7"/> who was <hi>to make mens peace by the bloud of his croſs, Col.</hi> 1. 20. they hid their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from, and eſteemed him not: Being puffed up with their own righteouſneſs and external priviledges and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they would not ſubmit unto the righteouſneſs of faith which is revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now they are hid from thy eyes.</hi> Chriſt here ſets forth the ſpiritual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they lay under, and likewiſe removes the ſcandal and offence which his infirm Diſciples might be apt to take, becauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did reject him. They had long refuſed to look unto the Lord, that they might be ſaved; and now God ſends them the ſpirit of ſlumber, eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and ears that they ſhould not hear, and hearts that they ſhould never underſtand. This is a very ſore and yet uſual puniſhment, when men receive the grace of God in vain, and are reſolved to walk contrary to the light which ſhines about them.</p>
            <p>The Text does yield ſeveral points of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is exceeding full of</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43094:7"/> 
               <hi>pity and compaſſion.</hi> His weeping here over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhews how kindly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioned he was towards them, and is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others in miſery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord does grant unto ſinners a day of grace, in which pardon and life are proffer'd to them, and may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them.</hi> If thou hadſt known in this thy day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To know in this day of grace the things which belong to our peace, is our great happineſs and wiſdom.</hi> If <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been ſo wiſe, her ruine would have been prevented.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>When ſinners will not ſee, they are ſmitten many times with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blindneſs, and the things of their peace are in a way of judgment hid from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Souls being thus left under darkneſs, their ſtate is wretched and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> Our Lord with tears laments this ſad condition of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The firſt Doctrine is this, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is exceeding full of pity and compaſſion.</hi> The tears which he ſhed prove this; and if tears will not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43094:8"/> a little after you may behold him ſhedding of his blood.</p>
            <p>This compaſſion of Chriſt extends it ſelf to them that periſh, as well as unto thoſe he ſaves.</p>
            <p>To them that periſh his compaſſion is ſeen in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In cauſing the Light whereby he is diſcovered to ſhine upon them.</hi> 'Tis a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that the loſt are told of a Saviour, that they are informed how ſin hath cauſed their miſery, and Chriſt is ſufficient to cure it. Nay herein <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Tender mercy appears, that the Day-ſpring from on high does viſit them that ſit in darkneſs, which can guide their feet into the way of peace, Luke</hi> 1. 78, 79. They need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> to underſtand the means of fallen mans recovery? <hi>The word is nigh,</hi> which can give a ſufficient information. 'Twas the great advantage of the <hi>Jews, that to them were committed the Oracles of God, Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. But now thoſe Oracles are pronounced more fully and plainly; and to enjoy them is the priviledge of ſuch, as in a Land of light have their lot given
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43094:8"/> them. It was great mercy towards <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi> that ſhe was lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſuch words were ſpoken, that ſuch works were done in her; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe improved not the mercy, how does our Lord upbraid her?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts compaſſion towards them that periſh is ſeen, <hi>in calling and inviting them to come to him:</hi> The Marriage-feaſt is prepared, and the ſervants are ſent into the high-wayes, to invite all to come, and partake of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Wiſdom cryeth without, ſhe uttereth her voice in the ſtreets, ſhe cryeth in the chief places of concourſe; How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity? and ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? turn ye at my reproof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. And <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. we read, <hi>Wiſdom hath killed her beaſts, ſhe hath mingled her wine, and furniſhed her table, ſhe hath ſent forth her maidens, ſhe cryeth upon the higheſt places of the City; Whoſo is ſimple let him turn in hither; as for him that wanteth underſtanding, ſhe ſaith unto him, come eat of my bread, and drink of my wine which I have mingled; forſake</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43094:9"/> 
               <hi>the fooliſh and live, and go in the way of underſtanding.</hi> Thus ſinners are called after, and though dogs, yet the ſame bread which is prepared for the children is proffer'd to them; the ſame ineſtimable benefits of Chriſt, as pardon, peace, grace, glory, are tendred to them, which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have accepted of; with the ſame eye-ſalve their eyes ſhall be annointed; with the ſame tried gold they ſhall be enriched; with the ſame white rayment all their nakedneſs ſhall be covered, if they will but come and cloſe with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſts compaſſion towards them that periſh is ſeen, <hi>in waiting long that he may be gracious;</hi> he knocks at the door, and he <hi>ſtands</hi> knocking there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3 20. He ſtands <hi>till his head is filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night.</hi> He ſees how Satan hath admiſſion at his pleaſure, and unto <hi>Mammon</hi> at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the door is ſet wide open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, but againſt Chriſt 'tis lock'd and bolted; and yet his love and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence overcomes theſe indignities, and he waits ſtill to ſee, if at laſt ſinners will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43094:9"/> conſult their own good, and entertain him. Chriſt by his Spirit ſtrives long, checking them from ſin, moving them to duty, demonſtrating the reaſonableneſs of converſion and obedience, the danger of continuance in their provocations. Chriſt does not go away at the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, nor curſe the Fig-tree for the firſt years unfruitfulneſs, but he digs about it and dungs it, and expects a great while, before that ſentence be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſts compaſſion towards them that periſh, is ſeen, <hi>in wiſhing, when for their obſtinacy they are given over to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they would have hearkened and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But in the ſecond place; the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord is manifeſted, and that principally to them that are ſaved; they are called <hi>Veſſels of mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt receives thoſe he ſaves, though they come home in rags:</hi> The beggarli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Prodigal did not hinder his Father from running to him, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him. Their emptineſs of worth doth not ſtir up his hatred, but his pitty. Chriſt hath enough, and to ſpare for them. Sinners ſhould not keep off from Chriſt, becauſe they cannot bring any grace of their own to commend them: He can put comelineſs upon thoſe, who by ſin are never ſo much deformed. When we come to our Lord we are over-ſpread with a leproſie, (iniquity is fitly called by that name) and all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is as filthy rags; now what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is it, that he takes away our filthy garments, and puts upon us the robe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:43094:10"/> 2. <hi>Chriſt makes reconciliation for the ſins of thoſe who are ſaved by him.</hi> And conſidering what wo and miſery ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardon'd expoſes the children of men to, 'tis an act of mercy to make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Wherefore in all thlngs it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt, in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> That load of <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>wrath,</hi> which elſe would ſink them into the loweſt Hell, the Lord Jeſus takes off from the Heirs of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt heals the wounds which their ſpiritual enemies have made.</hi> The good <hi>Samaritan</hi> had compaſſion upon the man that fell among thieves, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. Our Lord finds us in a worſe caſe; what wounds have our luſts and Satan made in our ſpirits? and truly they are incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by any but this Phyſician. When the fiery Serpents had ſtung the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> they looked unto the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and looking, they were healed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt gives reſt unto them that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and are heavy laden,</hi> Matth. 11. 28. Many are the burthens of believers, but he commands them to caſt all their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon him, and he promiſes to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain them. The curſe of the Law is a burthen, but <hi>Chriſt redeems them from the curſe of the Law, being himſelf made a curſe for them, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. They groan under the dominion of ſin, the bondage of corruption, but the Son of God pulls down ſins dominion, and makes them free indeed. Their poverty and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cauſes them to ſigh and complain; but Chriſt Jeſus unlocks his unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches, which are ſuperabundantly ſufficient to repleniſh them. And he that commands <hi>the rich in this world, to be ready to diſtribute, to be willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi> ſurely himſelf will in no wiſe be a Niggard of his ſpiritual Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt ſuccours thoſe he ſaves, in their temptation.</hi> In the hour of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43094:11"/> they very much need his pitty and aid, and they have both. <hi>Dido,</hi> in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> ſpake thus to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who were caſt upon her Coaſts,</p>

            <p>Thus of the firſt Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The ſecond follows, <hi>That the Lord does grant unto ſinners a Day of Grace, in which pardon and life are prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to them, and may be obtained by them.</hi> If thou hadſt known in this thy day. This day we read of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To day, if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts.</hi> Now Gods voice is heard, and that heart is both wicked and fooliſh, which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens it ſelf. See alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2. <hi>We then, as workers together with him, beſeech you, that ye receive not the grace of God in</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43094:14"/> 
               <hi>vain: for he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccour'd thee, Behold, now is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time; behold, now is the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Thoſe words <hi>(I have heard thee in a time accepted, in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccour'd thee)</hi> are ſpoken by God the Father unto Chriſt his Son. Chriſt himſelf had (in ſome ſenſe) a Day of Grace, in which the Father was well pleaſed with him; in which the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which he offered up once for the ſins of all, was accepted; in which his ſtrong cryes for himſelf, that he might be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the difficult work of Mans Redemption, were heard; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he was ſuccour'd, and enabled to work out a compleat ſalvation for the children of men. And hence it comes to paſs, that unto them alſo a day of grace is granted, in which they may be accepted, and ſalvation is brought near them, that they may lay hold upon it.</p>
            <p>My work in the handling of this truth will be: Firſt, to ſhew upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Seaſon of Grace is called a Day. Secondly, to declare what are the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43094:15"/> priviledges of this Day of Grace. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to lay down the properties of it. Fourthly, I ſhall give ſome reaſons why ſuch a day is granted. And then conclude with the Application.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Upon what account the Seaſon of Grace is called a Day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>in regard of the light that then ſhines.</hi> The Sun of Righteouſneſs is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and this Day is made by that Suns ſhining. <hi>Light</hi> from the Goſpel <hi>ſprings up unto them, which</hi> elſe would have <hi>ſat in darkneſs, and in the region and ſhadow of death, Matth.</hi> 4. 16. By this light things are diſcover'd which were hid from Ages and Generations. Gods eternal counſel to glorifie his Grace in the pardon, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cleanſing and ſaving of men that have all ſinn'd, and thereby come ſhort of his glory, is by this light made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
            <p>The light of Nature is but weak and dim, and cannot make it day; it gives ſuch a diſcovery both of God and ſin, as is ſufficient to leave thoſe that ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God without excuſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. But the way how enemies may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43094:15"/> it cannot ſhew. Nay, becauſe the firſt Covenant ran thus, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> the light of Nature doth ſtrongly incline us to put a confidence in our own works, then which nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel of the Grace of God.</p>
            <p>But though the Light of Nature be apt to lead out of the way, as well as imperfect, the Light of the Goſpel is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. All that are now in glory made uſe of this Guide in their paſſage through the world. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. doth make a compariſon between the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that of the Word: From the Heavens, Firmament, Sun, and Moon, and other Creatures, ſomething of the Glory of God may be diſcover'd: but then after he adds, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect;</hi> as if he had ſaid, From the Word ſhines forth a greater light, then from the Sun, and Moon, and Stars; a light, which guides infallibly to the Light that's everlaſting. And this Light is one thing, which makes the Day the text ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>in that it is deſign'd for working.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:43094:16"/> When the day comes, <hi>though the beaſts gather themſelves, and lay them down in their dens, yet man ariſes and goes forth to his work and labour till the evening, Pſal.</hi> 104. 22, 23. In like manner, this day of the Goſpel; though they, who are brutiſh, lay them down in the bed of eaſe, and fall aſleep in carnal ſecurity, yet ſuch as have the underſtanding of men, will go forth unto their work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and ſurely they who have luſts to mortifie, a world to overcome, a devil to reſiſt, and ſouls to ſave, have work enough to do. <hi>Why ſtand ye here all the day idle?</hi> (ſayes our Lord in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 6. Spiritual ſloth is now unſeaſonable and unreaſonable.

The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43094:16"/> Church is likened unto a Vineyard, and every one ſhould be a labourer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>in regard of the brevity and ſhortneſs of its continuance;</hi> It cannot exceed the term of natural life, and how ſhort that is experience ſhews, and the Scripture to affect us, doth expreſs by ſeveral nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſimilitudes: Sayes the Apoſtle, <hi>What is your life? It is even a vapour, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth for a little while, and then vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away,</hi> Jam. 4. 14. And <hi>Job</hi> 9. 25, 26. <hi>Now my dayes are ſwifter then a poſt, they flee away, and ſee no good; they are paſſed away as the ſhips of deſire, as the Eagle that haſteth to the prey.</hi> How faſt doth the Poſt ride? how ſwiftly doth the Ship ſail? what haſte doth the hungry Eagle make to the prey? Such ſpeed, O man, O woman, thou art making towards another world. The Day of Grace ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens as thy life ſhortens; reflect upon the opportunities thou haſt loſt with grief, condemn thy folly, and be ſo wiſe as now to redeem time, by doubled care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
            <p>And as this Day of Grace cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the bounds of life, ſo it may come
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43094:17"/> to a period before. Long reſiſting of the Spirit, and ſtanding out againſt the means of Grace, the Lord may, and often doth puniſh, by reſolving, his Spirit ſhall ſtrive no longer, and that to the working of Grace, the means ſhall never be made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual: The accepted time is not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>We may obſerve great difference in the dayes of the year; very long they are in the midſt of Summer, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with what they are in the depth of Winter. And verily ſuch an inequality there is between the day of grace, which ſome have, and which others do enjoy. And what knoweſt thou, O ſecure ſoul, who reckoneſt upon a long ſeaſon yet to come, but that thy day of grace may prove as it were a winters day, having not half ſo many hours, as to others are

            <p n="4">4. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>with relation to the night that is coming;</hi> and when the night is come, thy main work cannot be done, if then it be undone; and if it be undone, thou thy ſelf art undone for ever. <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me while it is day</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>the night cometh, when no man can work, John</hi> 9. 4. When the day of the righteous concludes, they reſt from their labour, and their works follow them; and though the night of death overſpreads their earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yet their ſpirits are made perfect, and 'tis an everlaſting day of glory with them. And on the other ſide, when the day of the wicked comes to a period, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are left under invincible blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deadneſs, and obduration; and how can they work then, unleſs the works of darkneſs? or elſe death finiſhes both the day of life and grace together, and then 'twill be too late to think of working, for they will be bound hand

            </p>
            <p>The priviledges of the Day of Grace are theſe following.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>One is the enjoyment of the Word of God.</hi> Becauſe of this <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old was

What was <hi>David</hi>'s judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it?

            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:43094:19"/>
            <p> Now in the Day of Grace this Word is vouchſafed; you both have it to ſearch into it your ſelves, and you have it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and applied by the miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You may ſearch into it your ſelves.</hi> How many thouſands under Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an bondage, enjoy not this priviledge, to have the Scriptures in a known tongue? The Word is the Souls food: Cruel Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts! who deny the ſoul bread. The Word is the Key, which unlocks the Treaſures both of Grace and Glory: Cruel Papiſts! who take away the Key of knowledge, enter not themſelves, and hinder thoſe that would. The Word is the Souls weapon, whereby the Wicked one is is overcome: Cruel Papiſts! who took this weapon out of its hand, and ſo betrayed it into the hands of Satan.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That all evils are cauſed by the Scriptures ignorance: Yet unto how many, under Popery, are the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied?</p>
            <p>It was thus in this our Land not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcores of years ago, Romiſh dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as thick here as in other places: But now the Buſhel is taken off from the Lamp of the Word, all may be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and directed by it, which fooliſhly ſhut not their eyes againſt it. You have the Word in your houſes, in your hands; oh that it were in more heads and hearts! You may daily have recourſe to this Word, for counſel, for quickning, and comfort; and if you will but give up your ſelves to it, that Promiſe ſhall aſſuredly be fulfilled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>When thou goeſt it ſhall lead thee, when thou ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it ſhall keep thee, when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee.</hi> As the Word doth guide and guard them that entertain it, ſo it talks with them, it tells them of ſuch things, as draw forth their deſires,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43094:20"/> inflame their love, put them upon labour, and fill them with unſpeakable joy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You have this Word opened and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the miniſtry of the Goſpel.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are yet with you, and that's a great priviledge, for <hi>with them</hi> Chriſt hath promiſed <hi>to be alwayes to the end of the world, Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> 'Tis their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to divide the Word, and to give to every one his portion. They foreſee the ſtorm, and warn the wicked to turn and fly unto a place of refuge, they encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thoſe who have true (though but weak) grace, and ſhew how thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Comforts, which they hear of, belong to them, though they are ſo apt to thruſt them away from themſelves. Miniſters, they do both bind and looſe, they bind the impenitent and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner under the curſe, under wrath, and he is bound in Heaven; for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the Goſpel paſſes upon him, is in Heaven ratified. But if the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſoul is broken, mourns for ſin, loaths it, leaves it; if the unbelieving ſinner, which before rejected Chriſt, receives him, then Miniſters have commiſſion to looſe him, whom before they bound, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43094:20"/> he is looſed in Heaven; whom the Word declares juſtified, to be ſure the God of Heaven hath acquitted. And truly Miniſters bind with this deſign, that afterwards they may looſe; they denounce threats, that, ſinners being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened and contrite, they may apply the Promiſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ambaſſadours of Chriſt, come and intreat you to be reconciled unto God, and as they inform you upon what articles he will be at peace with you, ſo they uſe many arguments to work upon your conſciences and affections; they will not let you alone in your vanity, but Sabbath after Sabbath cry to you, and tell you, that when you ruſh into ſin you ruſh into a battel, and 'tis againſt that great God, who muſt needs be too hard for you: Who ever fought with him, and got any thing but blows, wounds and death? <hi>Who ever hardned himſelf againſt him and proſpered? Job</hi> 9. 4. They are ever commending Jeſus Chriſt to you, and declaring how able, and how willing he is to ſave you, and how certain you are to be damn'd without him. And is it not a priviledge to be thus importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43094:21"/> for your own good? to have bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and life in a manner obtruded and forc'd upon you? Now Meſſengers of Peace are ſent in this Day of Grace; now glad tidings are brought, that God is willing to be reconciled; but when once you come to the Region of darkneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſuch tidings will never come to your ears more.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of this priviledge, to enjoy the Word, will further appear, if the admirable effects of the Word of God are duly conſidered.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Word of God doth make the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wiſe,</hi> Pſal. 119. 130. <hi>The entrance of thy words giveth light, it giveth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the ſimple.</hi> Thoſe, whom Satan before befool'd, putting them off with husks inſtead of what is ſolid and ſatisfying, are by the Word made too wiſe for this ſubtle Serpent: Now they are undeceived, and perceive how little fruit they have had of their evil works, therefore they are aſhamed of them, and of their own folly, in giving way to them. The Word diſcovers the pearl of price to them, and makes them wiſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they ſell all to purchaſe it: This
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43094:21"/> wiſdom which the Word infuſes, <hi>is not of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, which come to nought,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. The great ones of the earth may be prudent, in chuſing and ordering the means, for the attaining of the end which they aim at, but in the choice of their end, they diſcover the greateſt ſimplicity. All that greatneſs and glory, which they deſign, and themſelves alſo, will come to nought; Death will certainly and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily contract all their honour and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and cover it with thoſe two words, <hi>Hic jacet,</hi> Here it all lies buried. But the wiſdom, which the Word imparts, makes us to look higher, <hi>at a better and more enduring ſubſtance,</hi> at <hi>an inheritance which never fades away:</hi> And the Word ſhews, how by ſanctification we may be prepared for that inheritance; and thoſe who are made meet to be ſo, ſhall at length be made partakers of it. While the Day of Grace laſteth, thou mayſt be made wiſe to ſalvation; but if this be not improved, <hi>in the greatneſs of thy folly thou ſhalt go aſtray, and dye without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> Prov. 5. 23.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43094:22"/>
            <p> 2. <hi>This Word doth raiſe the dead to life.</hi> That Voice, <hi>Ariſe ye dead and come to Jeſus,</hi> muſt needs be powerful, ſince upon it follows the firſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>John</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> At the hearing of this Word of God, the Conſcience, which was before ſtupid, is ſtartled; the heart, that was all of ſtone, becomes a heart of fleſh, it is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſenſible, it feels the weight of ſin and of the curſe, and longs to be freed from both, though before it matter'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A new principle of grace is put into the Soul, whereby it is inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and acts for him. The Lord is breathed after, and there is a deſire to pleaſe him now, as there was formerly to pleaſe the fleſh, by fulfilling the luſts of it. O diſmal ſtate to lye dead in ſin! to be ſenſeleſs and unconcern'd under ſuch a load! But that's a life indeed, to be alive to God. And while this day of ſalvation continues, thou maiſt be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; but if this be loſt, the ſecond death will be thy portion, and then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43094:22"/> Life will be eternally farre from thee.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>This Word doth cleanſe thoſe defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which nothing in the world can do away. The Word of God</hi> is compared to <hi>fire,</hi> and to <hi>an hammer,</hi> as <hi>an hammer</hi> it breaks the rocky heart, and then as <hi>fire</hi> it melts the heart, and from its droſs doth purifie it: <hi>John</hi> 15. 3. <hi>Now are ye clean, through the Word which I have ſpoken to you.</hi> In the <hi>Word,</hi> as in a <hi>glaſs,</hi> we may behold the abominable filthineſs, and vile ingratitude, that is in ſin; and alſo the <hi>beauty of holineſs</hi> is preſented to our eye; no wonder then, if the former be abhorr'd, the latter deſired. Beſides, the Word holds forth a Promiſe from the Lord himſelf, <hi>to make the ſinner clean,</hi> and that <hi>from all filthineſs both of the fleſh and ſpirit, Ezek.</hi> 36. 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. The Day of Grace is a day of healing; now thou mayſt be purged and cured of thy ſpiritual plagues; but if this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be neglected, thou wilt dye of them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>This Word doth afford ſuch peace and joy, as the creatures cannot yield.</hi> Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, cannot yield
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43094:23"/> ſuch true comfort. Hark to <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 111. <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of my heart.</hi> In ſenſual mirth the heart is ſad, miſgives, and is unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but the Word makes the very heart joyful. In the Word, we may ſee at preſent the reconciled face of God, the frowns and other ſigns of anger gone, and it ſpeaks plainly of fuller manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and infinitely greater pleaſures, which are reſerved for hereafter; and the lively hopes of theſe, which are ſo near, as well as ſure and glorious, may well make the heart to leap for joy.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>This Word is able to build up thoſe who are converted, and to bring them ſafe unto their Country:</hi> 'Tis a means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the grace, which 'tis a means to work: As it is <hi>the incorruptible ſeed,</hi> whereby we are regenerated and begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again, ſo it is <hi>the milk</hi> wherewith we grow and thrive in holineſs. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</hi> I might add, That even thoſe whom the Word doth not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43094:23"/> ſavingly change, yet it prevails upon many times a great way, it brings them near to the Kingdom, and 'tis their own fault that they miſs of it.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the Word of God hath ſuch effects, that the enjoyment of it is a great priviledge, is without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
            <p>2. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace, <hi>is the preſence of the Spirit.</hi> The Word, and all other Ordinances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, are but like the carcaſs without the ſoul. He makes the <hi>Word quick and powerful, and ſharper then a two-edged Sword,</hi> which alſo would be found but a dead and inefficacious letter. 'Tis obſerved concerning the hotter Climates, that when the Sun is up, and begins to ſhine, and ſcorch more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, there is alſo a wind ariſes to fan and cool the dwellers there, elſe thoſe Regions would be uninhabitable. In like manner, where the Sun of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhines, there is the wind of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and theſe his gales, how refreſhing, how powerful are they? The acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſes of the Spirit are much to be obſerved and eſteemed; without his concurrence, no
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43094:24"/> advantage will be reaped by all the means of grace we uſe.</p>
            <p>If the ſeveral operations of the Spirit are conſider'd, 'twill be very evident what a priviledge of the Day of Grace this is, to enjoy his preſence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis the work of the Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi> Though the ſecure ones of the world had rather be let alone to ſleep on, and cannot endure to be jogged by conviction; yet theſe convictions are great mercies. What the Spirit doth convince the world of, our Lord informs us, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8. <hi>And when he is come, he will reprove or convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs and of judgment: of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me, of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, becauſe I go to the Father, and ye ſee me no more; of judgment, becauſe the Prince of this world is judged.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit convinces men of <hi>ſin;</hi> he ſhews the evil in it, and the danger of it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ſins, that grand one of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that is to ſay, their rejecting Chriſt ſo long, and ſlighting and refuſing the remedy he proffers, is in a ſpecial manner ſet home upon their hearts to their affliction and humbling. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43094:24"/> likewiſe of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> as well as of ſin. He diſcovers the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby all ſin may be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this righteouſneſs appears to be compleat and accepted, becauſe Chriſt is gone to his Father. Chriſt undertook by his ſufferings to ſatisfie for our offences; and if the ſatisfaction had not been full, he would never have been rid of the curſe, which, ſin being imputed to him, was laid upon him; neither would his righteous Father have ſuffered him to have ſit down in the Throne with him. But now ſince he is gone to his Father, and ſet down in the Throne, we may conclude, he hath paid the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our debt; and through him the Father is ready to ſhew grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to us. And if the conviction and ſight of ſin caſt down, the diſcovery of this righteouſneſs may again revive. 'Tis a happineſs to ſee our ſcores, ſince we are ſhew'd a way how to have them all croſs'd; were it not for the ſight of the one, we ſhould never mind the other.</p>
            <p>Again, the Spirit doth convince of <hi>Judgment.</hi> By <hi>Judgment</hi> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the condemnation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43094:25"/> and unbelieving, who, though they are convinced of ſin, continue in ſin; and though Chriſt be proffer'd, ſtill refuſe to embrace him. <hi>The Prince of this world is judged,</hi> and condemned; and ſhall theſe, who ſin againſt a remedy (which the Devil never did) eſcape? No certainly, <hi>God, who ſpared not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, knows how to reſerve the unjuſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of judgment to be puniſhed,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 4, 9. Or elſe by <hi>Judgment</hi> we may underſtand, the Government and Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>All power is given to him,</hi> and <hi>Judgment committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand. Satan, the Prince of this world, is already caſt out</hi> and overcome. And if he <hi>hath ſpoiled principalities and powers,</hi> certainly <hi>all his foes will be made his footſtool.</hi> Well then, it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all to ſubmit unto the Scepter of Chriſt, ſince elſe they will be daſh'd in pieces by him. And in this Day of Grace, Chriſt is ready to paſs by former rebellions, if you now will become obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis the work of the Spirit to renew.</hi> 'Tis a difficult matter to change an heart
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43094:25"/> that is ſo unconceivably wicked as mans is; and yet the Spirit doth effect this change; he ſhews his mighty power, in cauſing a vehement love to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect hatred. Sin, which was lov'd better then the ſoul, better then ſalvation, the heart by the Spirit is turn'd againſt it, and how earneſt are the cries that it may not reign, no, nor live any longer! And Holineſs, againſt which there was a very ſtrong, though unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable antipathy, is now hungred and thirſted after; there is a tide which runs upwards, contrary to the former ſtream which ran downward. The Lord hath thoſe affections, which before ſin and the world commanded. <hi>The deſart is become as Sharon,</hi> and in the ruines which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hath made, there is a Temple for the Spirit of God to dwell in. The Day of Grace is the only time to be made new creatures in. Now thy earthly heart may be made heavenly, thy impure heart cleanſed, thy mind, which was vain, carnal, enmity againſt God, may be made ſerious, and to approve, and ſubject it ſelf to the Law of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:43094:26"/> 3. <hi>'Tis the work of the Spirit to guide.</hi> They who are the children of God, are lead by him, and 'tis <hi>in the way everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he leads them;</hi> they are directed into ſuch a path, as will certainly bring them to the everlaſting enjoyment of the Eternal God. Neither doth he only guide, but ſtrengthen; the Spirit puts might into their inner man, and makes them to hold on their way, till they come to the bleſſed end of it. <hi>We have all like ſheep gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. But in this Day of Grace, the Spirit is near, to chalk out a path, in which we cannot miſs of happineſs, and to help us over all the ſtumbling blocks, and difficulties, which are caſt in our way. The Spirit doth alſo comfort as well as ſtrengthen: He ſheds abroad the ſenſe of the love o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God into the heart; and ſuch a joy iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues from this ſenſe of love, that tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot turn into ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Many of them that periſh, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, while this Day of Grace conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, of the Spirits workings.</hi> The Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43094:26"/> upon themſelves. Thus he did ſtrive with the old world in the day of their viſitation. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Chriſt was quickned by the Spirit, by which alſo he went and preached unto the ſpirits in priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of God wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the dayes of Noah.</hi> This place is wreſted, and may ſeem difficult, but the meaning is plainly this, That Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, by which Holy Ghoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the miniſtry of the ancient Patriarks, he preached unto the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners of the old world, whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are now impriſoned in hell, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43094:27"/> duty. But the Soul hankers after its beloved luſts and vanities, grows weary of the Spirits reſtraint, grudges the time and pains which duty takes up, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that the Spirit would go away, and accordingly the Holy Ghoſt departs from him. However this is true, that the Spirit works much, and would more, were he not reſiſted. That's the ſecond priviledge of the Day of Grace, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>3. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace, <hi>is liberty to come to the Throne of Grace.</hi> All fleſh is now invited to the Hearer of Prayers, and their prayers ſhall be regarded, if they no longer regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But ſome may object, <hi>Doth not the Scripture ſay, that the Lord and his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are far from the wicked? and therefore wicked ones have no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, But if the wicked man doth cry, that he may be renewed, and that his wickedneſs, both as to the guilt and practiſe, may be put far away from him, then the Lord will draw near immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>

And if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us to accept of mercy, ſhall not we ſpeed in our intreaties for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The promiſe which God hath made may now be pleaded.</hi> This is the time to lay hold upon his Covenant. <hi>Lord! thou haſt promiſed to blot out iniquity as a cloud; oh when ſhall this cloud be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, that I may walk in the light of thy countenance!

            <p>The worſt of men, <hi>the chief of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> may urge the promiſe of a new heart, and of waſhing from filthineſs, as long as <hi>they ſeek unto the God of Iſrael to do this for them, Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. and are ſo far wrought upon, as to deſire to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; the whole Covenant ſhall be made good to them, if their unbelief of Gods power and truth be not an hinderance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Now in this Day of Grace the great High-prieſt ſtands ready to intercede for us.</hi> Never any ſincerely begg'd for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and for grace, but Chriſt pray'd that Prayer over again, and a gracious return was made to it. The Spirit alſo is ready to help infirmities, to fill our hearts with ſuch deſires as ſhall be ſurely ſatisfied; and truly we have to do with a God, who of the beſt things, which are moſt needful, moſt deſirable, is alwayes moſt liberal. Now are the <hi>mollia fandi tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora,</hi> the times to ſpeak and ſpeed; but when this gracious ſeaſon is gone, ah then the loudeſt cries will be in vain; God will hear, Chriſt will intercede, the Spirit help no more.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43094:29"/>
            <p> 4. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace is this, <hi>That now the way is open to the Kingdom.</hi> As you may come to the Throne of Grace, ſo 'tis poſſible to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Throne of Glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> Our Lord doth ſtand, as it were, with a Crown of Life in his hand, and ſayes, <hi>Believe in me, and continue faithful to the death, and this Crown ſhall be put upon your heads.</hi> The Kingdom is offered, and the ſure way to the Kingdom is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. <hi>Life and Immortality are brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi> that is, ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and glorious life, as will never by death have a period; and if you <hi>ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, and patiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in well-doing,</hi> this eternal life ſhall aſſuredly be given you.</p>
            <p>The fooliſh Virgins had a Day o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We read of <hi>a Ladder that reached from earth to heaven;</hi> now there is a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of climbing up thither: But there is no Ladder that reaches from hell to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: If this preſent day of ſalvation be loſt, ſalvation it ſelf alſo will be loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>5. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace is this, <hi>That during this ſeaſon the ſtate of the wicked is not unalterable.</hi> 'Tis true, the Holy Ghoſt expreſly ſayes, that impenitent and unbelieving ones are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd already, Joh.</hi> 3. 18. Sentence of condemnation is paſt, but it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, if they at laſt are brought to mourn for their rejecting of a Saviour, and with their hearts <hi>believe in the Name of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of this faith will be freedom from condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> There was condemnation heretofore to them as well as to others, but now there is none, for they are in Chriſt, and ſhew it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the luſts and works of the fleſh,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43094:30"/> and giving themſelves up to the Spirits guidance.</p>
            <p>They whom ſin hath ſet at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from Chriſt, are called to come to him; and while this Day of Grace laſts, that word holds good, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> But when this day is done, then 'twill be, <hi>I will in no wiſe receive.</hi> The Lamb himſelf then will be full of wrath, and that's dreadful. The Lamb can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the anger of God, but who can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Lambs anger? When the only Reconciler is himſelf irreconcileable; when the only Interceſſour is inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; when the only Saviour puniſheth with everlaſting deſtruction, what hope of help remains then?</p>
            <p>But as yet 'tis poſſible for Rebels to obtain a pardon, and to be made children. Though thou haſt ſinn'd thy ſelf near to hell, yet thou haſt not ſinn'd thy ſelf into hell. Though ſin hath abounded, if thou art brought by the entring of the Law, to a ſence how thy offences have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Grace will much more abound, Rom.</hi> 5. 20. The Lord hath turn'd and chang'd as bad as the worſt of you, and that which hath been done may be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43094:30"/> ſince his hand is as mighty to ſave, and his Grace as free as ever.</p>
            <p>I have done with the priviledges of this Day of Grace. In the third place follow the properties of it, which are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This Day of Grace is uncertain, as to its duration,</hi> 'tis more uncertain then the day of life, for that may end before this doth: Nay, the Day of Grace may be paſt, while the very means of Grace continue. The acceptable time was paſs'd with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Prophet was ſent to preach among them. Hark what a ſad Commiſſion he had, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Go make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and convert, and be healed.</hi> 'Tis dreadful when the Word ſhall make the ear more deaf, and the Light the eye more blind, and awakening means the heart more groſs and ſtupid.</p>
            <p>The Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> had outſtood their day, and yet after this their Father ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes them, and endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them. They were laſcivious, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43094:31"/> 
               <hi>made themſelves vile;</hi> and <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid, <hi>'Tis no good report I hear of you, my ſons, ye make the Lords people to tranſgreſs: If one man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their Father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi> When Drunkards, Sorcerers, Liars, Whoremongers, Worldlings, are reproved often, and will not hearken, who knows but the ſeaſon of mercy may be ended, and the Lord intends to ſlay them, to damn them: And if at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this they are unconcern'd, there is greater cauſe to fear (though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abſolutely conclude) that 'tis ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>The day of grace is uncertain: the means of grace may be before you are aware removed. The golden Candleſtick doth not ſtand ſo faſt in any place, as that 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be took away. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that threatning uttered to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2. 5. <hi>I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi> And although Ordinances remain, a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43094:31"/> bleſſing may be withheld from them. Thou doeſt not know but every call may be the laſt time of asking, and Chriſt may for ever after hold his peace; and therefore preſently give conſent to be eſpouſed to him; thou doſt not know, but that every motion of the Spirit may have his laſt ſtriving with thee, and if thou ſtill reſiſteſt, the Spirit may take his leave, and ſay, <hi>Fooliſh Soul, go on in ſin, go on to hell, I will not ſtrive any more to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Day of Grace is exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:</hi> This is the very flower and cream of time. What's the reaſon the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> begs, the Lord would <hi>teach him to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his dayes aright? Pſal.</hi> 90. 12. What's the reaſon one Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time?</hi> Eph. 5. 15, 16. and another adviſes, <hi>Paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17. Surely theſe holy men ſaw more in time, then moſt in the world are aware of; they were ſenſible, the preſent time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Day of Grace; and that eternal Glory muſt now be got, or loſt for ever. If there were no hope at all of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43094:32"/> unto God, of obtaining mercy, and finding grace, alaſs our time would be of no value! But we may without prejudice to truth affirm, that time is more precious then gold; for now only Chriſt, who is ſo precious, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; now only the Soul, which is ſo precious, is to be ſecured.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle calls this the <hi>accepted time, and the day of ſalvation:</hi> If now we come the Lord will accept us, and give his Son, himſelf, and freely all things to us; and Salvation, which ſince we are loſt we ſo much need, ſhall not be denied. This Salvation is called <hi>Salvation of the Soul, Heb.</hi> 10. 39. The better part, the Jewel which the Deſtroyer principally aims at, and deſigns to make his prey, is ſecured. This ſalvation alſo is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>great, everlaſting, and ſalvation to the uttermoſt.</hi> From the greateſt evils the heirs of ſalvation are delivered, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly delivered, and that good work which is begun in them, ſhall be perfected to the uttermoſt, and all of them ſhall ſtand in Glory, as ſo many Monuments of Power, and Mercy, and Grace, unto Eternity. And is not the Day of Grace
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43094:32"/> precious, ſince a day of ſuch ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Day of Grace is a Day of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> The Arm of the Lord is now revealed, in making the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Goſpel to be believed; the ſame power is exerted in raiſing a ſinner to the life of faith, that was ſhewn in raiſing up Jeſus our Lord from the dead. Strong holds are pull'd down, reaſonings againſt Religion, as if it were either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, or intollerably burthenſom, are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced. Thoſe luſts, which before bare all the ſway, have a deadly wound, which ſhall not be healed again. Sins domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is overthrown, and the world is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, 'tis now under foot, which uſed to have its ſeat in the very heart. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers find this day a day of power. They are powerfully drawn to Jeſus Chriſt, and as powerfully upheld and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by him.</p>
            <p>And of this power the ungodly are not without ſome taſte and experience. Mighty convictions and reſtraints for a while they have, but by degrees they grow ſtupid, and get looſe again, and then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43094:33"/> fulfil their fleſhly and their worldly luſts with the greater eagerneſs; juſt as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being dam'd up, when that reſtraint is taken away, doth run with greater ſtrength and ſpeed for having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This Day of Grace it is but one when this is gone, another is not to be expected.</hi> In Nature there is a viciſſitude of day and night, even at midnight 'twill not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours before the morning and the light return, <hi>Soles occidere &amp; redire poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt;</hi> but the night which follows after the Day of Grace is everlaſting. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed light of the Goſpel will be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that which is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi> Life indeed will return again at the general reſurrection, but another ſeaſon of mercy will not be vouchſafed. The Day of Grace is like the Dove, which <hi>Noah</hi> ſent the third time out of the Ark, when once 'tis flown away, 'twill return no more. What mean the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs world to ſport, and play, and ſin away this golden ſeaſon? Every moment that ſlips by you is irrevocable; and 'tis but a little while, and the whole ſtock
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43094:33"/> will be ſpent of this accepted time: Oh improve ſome of it, at leaſt, before it be all gone.</p>
            <p>If after death you were certain to be ſent into the world again, and to hear the joyful ſound of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that the Lord again would try you, and wait that he might be gracious, then preſent careleſsneſs were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo much without apology. But ſince immediately upon your diſſolution, you muſt go to your long, your eternal home, either of weal or wo, oh let Eternity, which is juſt at the door, be provided for, before this your day be ended.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the Properties of the Day of Grace. In the fourth place I am to lay down the Reaſons, why ſuch a Day of Grace is granted. Several reaſons of this may be aſſigned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>One ſhall be drawn from the Son's Incarnation, and taking our nature on him.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, that unto man ſuch kindneſs is expreſſed. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Verily, he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:43094:34"/> 
               <hi>the ſeed of Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2. 16. He was made in the likeneſs of men, therefore mankind is the dearer to him. There is a difference put between apoſtate Angels and fallen men; I ſpeak even of thoſe, that through their own wickedneſs and folly miſs of ſalvation. The reprobate Angels never had a remedy provided, nor a Day of Grace afforded; Chriſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not their nature, but as ſoon as ever they had ſinned, they fell, like lightning, ſuddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, from Heaven to Hell. But man was not thus dealt with; even thoſe whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>Veſſels of wrath fitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, are yet endured with much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, Rom.</hi> 9. 22. Their ſalvation is in it ſelf really poſſible, I ſay, <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> though all things conſider'd, there is an impoſſibility of any other event, then the deſtruction of ſinners continuing in their rebellions; and this real poſſibility of ſalvation will make them caſt the whole blame of their perdition on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the day of ſalvation was trifled away, and the ſalvation of that day was neglected.</p>
            <p>This matter may be made more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43094:34"/> and plain by a ſimilitude. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. admoniſheth the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, who was to conduct him to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the voyage they were about to make, would be with much damage and hurt, not only of the lading and ſhip, but alſo of their lives. Who can deny, that the tarrying in the Haven where they were, and where they might have been in ſafeguard, was in it ſelf really poſſible? and they could not reaſonably lay the blame of their ſhipwrack on Gods decree and determination, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own raſhneſs. In like manner ſinners are admoniſhed, that if they go on in wickedneſs 'twill be to their hurt and eternal damage, not only of their lives, but alſo of their ſouls. Who can deny, that the abſtaining from ſuch and ſuch ſins is really poſſible? therefore Gods decree is not to be blamed (which brings no coaction upon the will of man) but mans own perverſneſs, if he is wrack'd, and miſcarries to eternity.</p>
            <p>We read of the <hi>kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards man appearing, Tit.</hi> 3. 4. The Son of God was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh of man; and upon this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43094:35"/> ſcore it is that light comes into the world, and ſhines even upon thoſe dark ſouls that are unwilling to comprehend it, and ſalvation is proffer'd alſo unto them that refuſe to embrace it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Day of Grace is granted, <hi>that the power of God may be known.</hi> His power is much ſpoken of in the Goſpel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers feel the wonderful effects of that power. We are inform'd of a twofold Creation, the firſt and the ſecond, the old and the new: In the firſt Creation, the power of God was glorious indeed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> making the world out of nothing; but here, as there was nothing to help, ſo there was nothing to reſiſt this power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God: But in the new Creation, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new creatures, there is a great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and reſiſtance met withall, and how glorious is the power of God that overcomes it? What wonders are wrought in this day of Grace by the hand of the Lord? He not only ſayes, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> where darkneſs is, but where dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is loved: He not only ſayes, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> to them that are dead, but to them that are unwilling to be raiſed. <hi>Indiſpoſition</hi> and <hi>oppoſition</hi> likewiſe are to be found in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43094:35"/> ſinners, when the Lord firſt comes to work upon them. The Bullock cannot endure the yoak, though hereby its life is lengthened; for the beaſt that works not is fatted immediately for the ſlaughter. A ſinner is likened <hi>to a bullock unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to the yoak, Jer.</hi> 31. 18. he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a great reluctancy and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to yield; now in turning ſuch an one (with whoſe corruption and luſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan joyns, to hinder converſion) the power of God is the more to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Day of Grace is granted <hi>for the manifeſtation of divine goodneſs and mercy.</hi> The Lord is ſaid to <hi>delight in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7. 18. therefore he allows a day, in which mercy may be had, and now it is to be obtained or never. It is not ſmall mercy that raiſes the ſons of men out of thoſe depths of miſery into which they are fallen: <hi>Great is thy mercy towards me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; and the greatneſs of it is demonſtrated, <hi>for thou haſt redeemed my ſoul out of the loweſt hell.</hi> And if the unworthineſs of man be duly conſidered, the freeneſs of this mercy is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as much as the abundance of it. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43094:36"/> is free, as well as plenteous; 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed not only above deſert, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſert, nay contrary to deſert; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to that ancient Fathers phraſe, 'tis <hi>Omni modo gratuita,</hi> free eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way. Hence it is, that Saints have uſed that as an argument to obtain mercy, which o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> would have thought ſhould have quite diſcouraged them from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any hopes of it, namely, <hi>the greatneſs of ſin.</hi> Pſal. 25. 11. <hi>For thy Name ſake pardon my iniquity, for it is great;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, I know 'tis thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this day of grace to manifeſt and to magnifie thy mercy; and the greatneſs of my ſin will ſerve to ſet thy mercy higher; the richneſs and freeneſs of it will be the more wondred at, becauſe ſhewn to a groſs tranſgreſſour.</hi> Mercy, nay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, abundant mercy is expreſſed in juſtifying the ungodly, in quickening the dead, and <hi>begetting them again to a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. And this is the only ſeaſon; if it be not now laid hold on, it will be clean gone for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Day of Grace is granted, <hi>that the Lords long-ſuffering and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may be wondred at.</hi> He is an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43094:36"/> of all the wickedneſs that is done againſt him; he hates all the ſin he ſees, and can eaſily take vengeance upon the committers of it; he ſtands not in the leaſt need of any of them, and yet he ſpares them, and that a great while: Oh how great is the ſtock of his patience? <hi>Lord! what is man that thou doeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear him ſo long, ſince thou canſt ſo eaſily cruſh him! How comes it to paſs, that thou doeſt call after him to benefit him, ſince thou canſt not be benefited by him! and notwithſtanding many provocations art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing he ſhould periſh!</hi> Oh wonderful patience, that will leave the abuſers of it without any the leaſt apology; and that will be matter of everlaſting marvel to thoſe, who hereby are lead unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance!</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Day of Grace is granted, <hi>that the righteouſneſs of the Lord in thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities, which are ſhew'd upon the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and unbelieving, may be the more evident and undeniable.</hi> He will be ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtified when he ſpeaks, though never ſo amazing a ſentence be utter'd by him; <hi>he will be clear when he is judged:</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who had a day of Grace and loſt it,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43094:37"/> an acknowledgment will be extorted from them, that they are juſtly puniſhed, with the loſs of endleſs bleſſedneſs, which they frequently heard of, and as often ſlighted.</p>
            <p>When God ſhall thus plead with the Impenitent at his Bar; <hi>Did not I give you a day as well as others? Did not I call, and you refuſe? Did not I ſtretch forth my hand, and you diſregarded me? Did not I give you counſels, and reproofs, and you ſet them all at naught?</hi> And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall bid them depart away, never to ſee his face more: How will all the Saints and Angels approve of the Sentence, and cry, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, becauſe thou haſt thus judged!</hi> and the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will not have one ſyllable to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>Now I deſcend to the Application: And I ſhall begin with ſome Conſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that may be drawn from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In this Day of Grace, to ſleep is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improper. Let us not ſleep, as do others,</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>but let us watch, and be ſober; for they that ſleep ſleep in the</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:43094:37"/> 
               <hi>night, and they that be drunken are drunken in the night; but let us who are of the day be ſober, putting on the breaſt-plate of faith and love,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. How long wilt thou ſleep, O ſluggiſh Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? when wilt thou awake? ſhall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing force thine eyes open? The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our ſalvation are far from ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ply their buſineſs to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our ruine, and ſhall not we awake for our own ſecurity? How can we watch unleſs we are awake? and if we are not vigilant, how certain are we to be devoured by the roaring Lion? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light;</hi> and light being given to ſee withall, <hi>ſee that thou walk circumſpectly.</hi> The Sun of Righteouſneſs is up, and ſhining, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be up and doing. Sloth in this mid-day of the Goſpel is unſutable as well as dangerous; the Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cautions againſt it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lethurgy of the Conſcience is a ſore malady; when the ſinners heart is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43094:38"/> ever and anon ready to drop aſleep, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the means which are uſed to rouze it. But though threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though judgments will not awaken ſome, that are ſeized upon by the ſpirit of ſlumber, yet I'll tell you what will do it, The ſight of an angry ſin-revenging Judge upon the Tribunal; the ſeeing and feeling of the torments of Hell, will awaken them that are moſt faſt aſleep in ſin: What wilt thou ſleep upon the pits brink? Uſually ſinners fear leaſt, when becauſe of the nearneſs of evil they have moſt reaſon to be afraid.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How much beſides themſelves are they, whoſe whole employment is the works of darkneſs in this day time.</hi> The Apoſtle exhorts us, <hi>to caſt off the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to put on the armour of light, Rom.</hi> 13. 12. Light is a kind of armour, for the light making a diſcovery of ſins deceitfulneſs, the heart is hereby arm'd againſt temptation; but becauſe moſt do love their evil deeds, therefore they hate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43094:38"/> works of wickedneſs are rightly termed <hi>the works of darkneſs;</hi> the actors of them fly the light, for when they are ſeen they cauſe ſhame; and from God, who is light, they hinder us: allowance of theſe, and fellowſhip with him are inconſiſtent; moreover, unto <hi>outer darkneſs</hi> theſe works have a moſt certain tendency.</p>
            <p>Now ſhall a Day of Grace be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſins drudgery? This was given as a day of ſalvation, and ſhall we in it work out our own condemnation? Shall it be ſpent in making ſure of Hell, and <hi>treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath?</hi> When the Lord doth grant us a day to make our peace, ſhall we give this day to Satan, and do nothing, but by wicked works more alienate our ſelves, and make the wall of ſeparation higher? If the ſeaſon that was allotted for the obtaining of mercy be abuſed, only to the aggravating of ſin, and augmenting of miſery, this will argue you guilty of ſuch a folly and madneſs, as muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd beyond hyperbole.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What cauſe is there of thankfulneſs for ſuch a Day of Grace?</hi> The Iſraelitiſh ſervants prized the year of Jubilee, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43094:39"/> much more ſhould we this, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The light doth ſhine more clearly in this our day, then it did of old.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jewiſh Church enjoyed but the dawning, or at moſt, the early morning of this Day of Grace, but we the noontide of it; many ſhadows of good things to come they had, whereby thoſe things were obſcurely repreſented; but we have under the Goſpel the ſubſtance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and the ſhadows are flown away. <hi>Moſes,</hi> the great Prophet of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had a vail upon his face, to ſignifie that his was a more dark diſpenſation; <hi>but we all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>with open face, beholding, as in a glaſs, the glory of God, are ebanged into the ſame image, from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory, even as by the Spirit of the</hi>

               <hi>Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Chriſt is now more fully diſcover'd, his ſweet offices more explain'd, and his precious benefits more gloriouſly diſplayed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We ought to be thankful that this our day hath ſo long laſted.</hi> The Lord long ago might have <hi>given us up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate mind,</hi> nay, fetter'd us in chains of darkneſs, becauſe of our hating know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and <hi>holding the truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> 'Tis a wonder, that having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much againſt the light, we have not ſinn'd the light away. I read, that at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s requeſt, <hi>the Sun ſtood ſtill in the Firmament, and haſted not to go down for an whole day, Joſh.</hi> 10. 13. And have not we had experience of the like mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Grace? Hath not the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſtopt his courſe, not haſting to go down? How long hath Chriſt ſtood waiting? and ſtill he ſtands proffering both light and life, and light and life ſhall be given to them that underſtand the value of ſuch offers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Eſpecially we have cauſe to praiſe, if this Day of Grace hath been effectual, and we have been made the children of light, and of the day.</hi> Moſt even in this Day of

If he had not enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened our eyes; we ſhould have ſlept the deep of death as well as others. Was there not a time, when we did not ſee either our ſin, or our extream danger? Was there not a time when we were as unſenſible of the worth of ſouls, and of our need of Jeſus, as the moſt careleſs ones? Oh wonderful love, that he hath made the difference, and diſtinguiſhed us from others! that hath illuminated and converted us, when others are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſtill to run on blindfold towards ruine!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Since ſuch a day of Grace is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>the ſpecial ſeaſons of it ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:</hi> The whole is precious, but ſome ſeaſons are more golden, and to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed at an higher rate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Seaſon of Youth.</hi> This is the fitteſt time to ſow the ſeed of Grace, that

The journey towards the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is long, the diſtance which ſin hath ſet us at from our Creatour is great, therefore to be ſetting forth betimes is a great part of wiſdom: The Lord doth take it well, when in our youthful dayes we make choice of him. <hi>Samuel, Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah, Joſiah, Timothy,</hi> have a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given them, that they knew, and loved, and feared God betimes; that they abſtained from, and deſpiſed thoſe luſts and vanities, with which youth moſt commonly is enſnared and defiled. The time of youth is a time of ſtrength, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and activity; then you will either do much for God, or much againſt him. In the ſervice of ſuch a Maſter as the Lord is, how well will your ſtrength be employed? Activeneſs will here become you.

Oh therefore withſtand ſin betimes, uſe the ſame policy in reference to your luſts, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> would have uſed towards <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they feared leſt the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> when grown, might be too hard for them, therefore they endeavoured in their weak infancy to deſtroy them. To ſee young faces ſet towards <hi>Sion,</hi> the way thither being diligently enquired after; to behold children turn Souldiers in the ſpiritual warfare, fighting under Chriſts Enſign, making the Tempter flee from them, taking Heaven by ſtorm and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; what a brave ſight is it!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Seaſon of Health is another ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be improved.</hi> Then the body is a more fit inſtrument to ſerve the ſoul in the Lords ſervice. The time of ſickneſs is moſt commonly a time of ſpending; therefore in health you ſhould be treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up good ſtore of Grace. Now you may attend upon the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you may come to Gods Houſe, and ſit down at his Table; but ſickneſs will deprive you of ſuch opportunities. Now you ſhould be labouring for Grace, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43094:42"/> trying your grace, that you may not be deceived with what is but counterfeit. You ſhould be ſo wiſe, as to foreſee the evil day of affliction and infirmity a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and beg beforehand for ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith as may make you ſtand, ſuch a meaſure of patience and ſubmiſſion, that there may not be the leaſt repining thought againſt God; but whatever your trials are, that you may not faint, but acquieſce in the wiſdome and grace of him, by whom you are chaſtized. Beg alſo beforehand for a ſenſe of his Love, and when you ſee the rod in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand, none of the ſtripes will be intollerable. Let health be thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: And to perſwade you, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that what you do in the day of health will be more upon choice, and not upon force, and conſequently your ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will be the more evident; whereas if you are forced to ſeek the Lord by his ſmiting of you, whether your hearts are right, may be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Seaſon of ſpiritual Plenty ſhould alſo be with care and diligence improved.</hi> When heavenly Manna falls ſo thick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your habitations, ſhall none at all

Let every one in this Aſſembly think thus with himſelf, <hi>How many ſcores of Sermons have been preached to me? how many warnings have I had? how many reproofs have been given me? how often have I been exhorted to obedience? how many prayers have I joyned in? But what fruit have I to ſhew of all? What grace have I gotten? what luſt have I got the maſtery over? Where's the faith, the love, the zeal, the holineſs and humility, which might have been attained if theſe means of grace had been, as they ought to have been, improved?</hi>

            <p>Ordinances in abundance are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed: ſhall they be but prices in the hands of fools? Where the Lord gives ſo much, to be ſure he will require the more. Oh lament your paſs'd non-proficiency, and for the future let your whole heart be in every duty; be moſt earneſtly deſirous to get ſomething from God every time you draw near to him You neglect your

            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what are the ſpecial Seaſons of the Day of Grace, which not to lay hold upon, is to be falſe to your ſelves, and regardleſs of your chief advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <label>USE. II. <hi>Of Caution.</hi>
               </label> There are three evils which I muſt warn you to beware of. Firſt, <hi>Preſume not upon the laſting of this Day of Grace.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Don't raſhly conclude the Day of Grace is paſs'd.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Take heed of being ſtrengthned, and emboldened</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:43094:45"/> 
               <hi>by the general practice to idle it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Preſume not upon the laſting of this Day of Grace,</hi> Preſumption is a ſin as common as unreaſonable. How many thouſands are now deſpairing in Hell, becauſe of the vain hopes, and falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, which here on earth they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? 'Tis an ordinary deluſion, for the ungodly to imagine, that either they have believed and repented already, or that there will be time enough ſeveral years hence to do it: and after they have deferred their main work long, they are apt to defer it longer: <hi>Tanquam ſemper victuri vivunt, Sen.</hi> They live as if they were to live alwayes, and as if the Day of Grace were not a day, but a kind of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. 'Tis a notable paſſage of <hi>Gregory, Hom.</hi> 12. <hi>in Evang</hi> If every one knew (ſayes he) when he were to go out of this preſent world, then he might more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably allot this part of his time for pleaſure, and that for repentance, <hi>Sed qui poenitentiae veniam ſpopondit, peccanti cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinum non promiſit.</hi> But he that promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pardon to them who repent of ſin, hath not engaged to give another day to them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43094:45"/> that go on in ſin. Let two things here be laid to heart.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Preſumption is the way to make the Day of Grace altogether unavailable.</hi> Men will not ſeriouſly mind eternity, while they think they have time enough before them. Thou who reckoneſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Sabbaths yet to come, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Sermons yet to be heard, the preſent Sabbaths are loſt, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sermons are little heeded, leſs pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, and thou thy ſelf leaſt of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Preſumption is the way to ſhorten this Day of Grace, and to haſten the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting nights approach.</hi> The evil ſervant that ſaid in his heart, <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming,</hi> is threatned, <hi>The Lord of that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant will come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</hi> much ſooner then he was aware, <hi>and cut him aſunder, and appoint him his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the hypocrites, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, Matth.</hi> 24. 48, 49, 50, 51. The rich man in the Goſpel preſumed upon many years, but he had not many hours of his time remaining; God called him <hi>Fool,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>This night</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:43094:46"/> 
               <hi>thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> If an earthly Maſter bid his ſervant go and work to day, and he anſwer, he will ſet about his work a week, or a moneth hence; how can the Maſter chuſe but be provoked? he juſtly turns that ſervant out of doors, allowing him no longer time to tarry. The Lord, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, bids the Sons of men to work to day, If they anſwer, Many years hence 'tis time enough; How can he chuſe but be incenſed, and his diſpleaſure may cauſe the ſeaſon of mercy to end ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
            <p>Now that I may further ſtrike at and ſtartle this preſumption, I ſhall propoſe and anſwer one Caſe of Conſcience. <hi>When have ſinners cauſe to fear that the Day of Grace is growing towards evening, and ready to conclude with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. One ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <hi>long and unbewail'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs:</hi> When they who have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the means of Grace, are either empty Vines, or bring forth fruit unto themſelves: when the Lord hath come, not three years only, but ten, twenty,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43094:46"/> thirty years together, ſeeking fruit, but hath found none; and (which is worſt of all) their barrenneſs is not their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; 'Tis to be feared, that the axe will ſpeedily be laid to the root, that they will quickly be cut down, and be made fuel for that fire that is unquenchable. You have a notable Parable of a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard planted in a very fruitful hill, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. <hi>'Twas fenced, the ſtones were gathered out; but when grapes were expected, behold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but leaves, and wild grapes,</hi> ver. 4. But upon this God reſolves <hi>to take away the hedge, and his vineyard ſhall be eaten up, to break the wall, and it ſhall be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down; he reſolves to lay it waſte, it ſhall not be pruned nor digged, there ſhall come up briars and thorns, and the clouds are commanded to rain no rain upon it,</hi> ver. 5, 6. You that have been long unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and this hath never troubled you, how ſoon may the clouds be commanded to rain no rain upon you? how ſoon may the influences of heaven be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther withheld from you? how ſoon may barrenneſs be your puniſhment, which is your ſin, the Lord in judgment reſolving, that never fruit ſhall grow upon you?</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:43094:47"/>
            <p> 2. Another ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <hi>great ſecurity.</hi> The old world were thus ſecure, when the Lord reſolved the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not much longer ſtrive with them. Great ſecurity was the forerunner of the <hi>Jews</hi> rejection. They would not believe their ſins were ſo heinous, or that God was ſo much diſpleaſed with them; they would not believe the Meſſiah, who told them of their maladies, and proffer'd to cure them. And the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>becauſe of unbelief they were broken off,</hi> Rom. 11. 20. And ſuch ſecurity will go before the end of the world, when the Day of Grace ſhall conclude with all, and when time it ſelf ſhall be no longer: How far are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſouls from being in a ſecure ſtate? <hi>When they cry peace and ſafety, how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly may trouble and deſtruction come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which they ſhall not eſcape?</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 3.</p>
            <p>3. Another ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <hi>unlamented indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, whether or no it do continue.</hi> If you are of an indifferent ſpirit, whether you enjoy the light, or it be put out in obſcurity; whether you hear the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43094:47"/> of glad tidings, or whether their mouths be ſtopp'd; there is reaſon to be afraid the Lord is about to diveſt you of thoſe priviledges, which you know not how to value. If you look upon ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual darkneſs, as no plague, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worſe then that of <hi>Egypt;</hi> if you eſteem the famine of the Word (which is worſe then <hi>a famine of bread,</hi> or <hi>a thirſt of water, Amos</hi> 8. 11.) no ſuch great judgment, as long as from temporal judgments you are exempted, this is a moſt wretched temper of ſoul; and the Lord muſt needs be angry, when the greateſt mercies and favours are ſlighted; and what puniſhment more probable or equal then to be deprived of them?</p>
            <p>4. Another ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <hi>contradicting and perſecuting of the Lords Meſſengers.</hi> We read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. of a Marriage feaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, ſervants are ſent forth to invite many to the Marriage; ſome, who were invited, took thoſe ſervants and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them ſpightfully. Could the King, which made this Supper bear this? No, he was wrath, and did deſtroy theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43094:48"/> and none of them were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to partake of thoſe good things he had provided, and once proffer'd to them. That is a dreadful text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. <hi>But they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, and there was no remedy.</hi> The Apoſtles <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Goſpel, the multitude flock to hear them; when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and ſpake againſt the Apoſtles doctrine; but the Apoſtles ſeeing them reject 'the Goſpel, and them, in ſuch a way, make this reply, <hi>It was needful that the Word of God ſhould be firſt ſpoken unto you, but ſince you put it from you,</hi> you ſhall not be troubled with it, <hi>lo, we turn to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Acts</hi> 13. 45, 46. and then to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did the light ariſe and ſhine forth, and the <hi>Jews</hi> were left under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Another ſign the Day of Grace is near an end, if not quite ended, is <hi>obſtinacy in ſome opinions, which are damnable.</hi> When fundamental truths are denied, when all means uſed to reclaim and turn the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,

               </gap>e, do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and harden them, how near to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate is their caſe? When the Lord ſends ſtrong deluſions to any, and they believe a lye, oh 'tis to be feared he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their ruine, and that <hi>their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not linger,</hi> will not flumber long: 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Errour may extinguiſh the light of the Goſpel, and cauſe the Ordinances of God to be ſlighted, the Word to be caſt aſide, and the Spirit to depart, and leave ſinners to the ſeduction of Satan, and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their dark and fooliſh hearts. Let me therefore ſpeak to you in the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Ye therefore, beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leſt ye alſo being lead away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Another fatal ſign, that the Day of Grace is near its period, is <hi>an habit of back-ſliding.</hi> Hark how the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids his people with this; and after,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43094:49"/> they are told of their deſperate ſtate; <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 4, 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſhall they fall and not ariſe? ſhall they turn away, and not return? why is this people of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſlidden back with a perpetual back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding?</hi> And then it follows, ver. 20, 21, 22 <hi>The Harveſt is paſt, the Summer is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we are not ſaved. For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am black, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment hath taken hold upon me. Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recover'd?</hi> There are many Profeſſours, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times look <hi>Sion-</hi>ward, and have ſome common work upon them, but after do draw back, and by often doing ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſuch a ſcaredneſs, that they make light of doing ſo. They do poſſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome awakenings confeſs their ſins, but quickly return to the commiſſion of them again; they are convinced 'tis their duty, and yet they will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do the work of the Lord vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, they are convinced of ſuch and ſuch ſins, and yet they will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from following after them. They may have a <hi>form of godlineſs,</hi> but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43094:49"/> they will not be brought under the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſs,</hi> nor give their conſent to be ſincerely and thorowly ſanctified. Divers motions and proffers of aſſiſtance they have had from the Spirit, but all in vain, they are bent upon backſliding. Surely then they have juſt ground to fear, that ſentence is ready to be, if not already pronounced, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus concerning the Signs when the Day of Grace is declining and drawing towards night. Preſumptuous ſoul, if thou findeſt in thy ſelf any of theſe ſigns, oh ſtartle exceedingly at the diſcovery, and before the laſt hour of the day be ended, enter into, and labour to purpoſe in the Lords Vineyard.</p>
            <p>2. A ſecond word of Caution is this, <hi>Don't raſhly conclude the Day of Grace is paſs'd, and that the Sun is already ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.</hi> This is an extreme contrary to that of preſumptuous ones, which tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and troubled ſpirits are very prone to run into. They are ready to takeup <hi>Jobs</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:43094:50"/> complaint, only with ſome ſad variations, <hi>Oh that I were as in moneths paſt, as in the dayes when God would have preſerved me! when his candle ſhined upon my head, and by his light I might have been deliver'd from the power of darkneſs! The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was then with me; he call'd upon me to turn, and was ready upon my turning to hear my calling to him. But now I cry, and he doth not hear me; I ſtand up, and he regards me not: I have ſo bitterly provoked him to leave me, that I am afraid he is now gone for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things are here to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>No man can certainly conclude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning another, that his day is paſs'd.</hi> If we conſult the Scripture, we ſhall find thoſe that have gone far in wickedneſs at laſt reclaimed; therefore we ſhould not deſpair of the worſt. Indeed the pride and ſtubbornneſs of the ungodly makes us fear that all our labour will be in vain, yet we ſpeak ſtill, <hi>and exhort and reprove with all long-ſuffering,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with God all things are poſſible; and thoſe ſheep that are gone much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, ſeemingly paſt reach, he can lay
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43094:50"/> hold of, and bring home again to the fold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>No man ought to draw ſuch a ſad concluſion in reference to himſelf, that the ſeaſon of mercy is quite expired.</hi> Though our election may be made ſure, yet repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is not preſently to be diſcover'd: Though upon thy comparing thy heart and life with the Word of God, thou mayſt know of a certainty thou haſt no grace; yet thou haſt no warrant to ſay, thou never ſhalt have any: As filthy as thou have been waſhed; as unholy as thou have been ſanctified; as guilty as thou have been <hi>juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When Satan peſters you with thoughts, that there is no help remaining, but the acceptable time is all ſlipt away, rather hope the contrary;</hi> for Satan is a liar; and becauſe he is ſo buſie about you, 'tis a ſign that he is afraid of looſing you; if he knew certainly that your day of viſitation were gone, he would be ſure of you, and ſo he would be quiet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ou.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:43094:51"/>
            <p> But for the further relief of thoſe, who are apt to diſcourage themſelves, and to damp their own endeavours after grace, by thinking the day is ended, and 'tis now too late, I ſhall do two things. Firſt, <hi>Lay down ſome probable ſigns.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Some certain ſigns of this Day of Grace's continuance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>probable ſigns</hi> of its continuance are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the heart is inclined to ſit under powerful means, who knows but by the word of faith which you attend upon, the grace of faith may be wrought in you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When ever and anon the heart i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. When thoſe falſe grounds of hope which you have built upon, are more and more diſcover'd; when you are mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Who knows, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten off from inſufficient bottoms, you may at length be ſettled upon the right foundation, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When there is a great fear leaſt the Day of Grace ſhould be paſt, 'tis to be hoped that 'tis not paſt. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the text was far from any ſuch fear. Uſually ſouls are left ſenſeleſs, when the Lord leaves them. Of the old world, and of <hi>Sodom</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>They eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded, they married and were given in marriage,</hi> and minded nothing elſe but things of this nature, though the floud was ſo near the one, and fire ready to conſume the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When ſinners are inquiſitive what they ſhall do to be ſaved, 'tis probable at leaſt, that the day of ſalvation is not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, but ſalvation is near, and may be obtained, if the terms on which 'tis proffer'd are not quarrel'd at, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to as good and equal.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place follow the <hi>certain ſigns</hi> that the Day of Grace is not yet concluded.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:43094:52"/>
            <p> 1. <hi>This day is not paſs'd when the Soul is for peace with God upon any conditions.</hi> If this be the yielding frame and temper of thy heart, certainly thou doſt not only know, but alſo art willing to do the things which belong unto thy peace. If this be thy language, <hi>Lord! Doth a right eye offend thee? it ſhall be pluckt out: doth a right hand offend thee? it ſhall be cut off: Thoſe ſins that ſeem moſt ſweet and neceſſary, as long as thou hateſt them, that is ſufficient to diſcommend them, I am reſolved to love them no longer!</hi> Thou haſt no reaſon to give up all for loſt: No, no, being thus made willing to <hi>caſt away every tranſgreſſion, iniquity ſhall not be thy ruine,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30.</p>
            <p>2. This Day of Grace is not paſs'd, <hi>when the ſinner ſets open the door of his heart; that Chriſt the Lord may enter.</hi> That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is moſt ſure, <hi>If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him, and ſup with him, and he ſhall ſup with me, Rev.</hi> 3. 20. Chriſt complains of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>They would not come to him that they might have life;</hi> but if any are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come, the waters of life are open,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43094:52"/> and none that deſire ſhall be denied them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Let him that is a thirſt come, and whoever will, let him drink of the waters of life freely.</hi> Doeſt thou know Chriſt? Art thou acquainted with his Kingdom as well as his Prieſthood? and art thou willing to have his Kingdom ſet up in thy heart, and thy very thoughts and affections brought into obedience and captivity? Art thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thus to receive him? Certainly thou ſhalt be received by him, and <hi>have power to become a child of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>3. This Day of Grace is not paſs'd, <hi>if Grace be deſired above all things in the world.</hi> If the edge of thy appetite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the things that periſh is turn'd, if the pearl of price be indeed of price in thy eſteem; if that be thy will and deſire, which is <hi>the will of God, even thy ſanctification;</hi> ſurely the Spirit is ſo far from having left thee, that he is in thee: 'Tis he who raiſes this <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs,</hi> which as it <hi>ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> ſo it argues thy eſtate bleſſed, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
            <p>5. This Day of Grace is not paſs'd, <hi>when the heart is grieved for the</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:43094:53"/> 
               <hi>miſpence of ſo much of this day, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to live the reſt of it to the will of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2. If you judge that the time paſt of your life doth ſuffice, nay, more then ſuffice, to have been fooliſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to God, and to have obey'd and ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures, and if you reſolve to dedicate the remainder of your lives in the fleſh to the Lord, that he may diſpoſe of it, certainly the Lord will accept both of your time and you: Though you come in late, ſo it be but preſently, into the Vineyard, you ſhall receive a penny; and diligence in your Maſters work will be rewarded with your Maſters joy.</p>
            <p>3. A third word of Caution is this, <hi>Take heed of being ſtrengthned and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned by the general practiſe to idle this Day of Grace away.</hi> We read concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Laiſh, That the people dwelt careleſs, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and ſecure, Judg.</hi> 18. 7. And truly this is the manner of moſt in the world, careful poſſibly they are about many things, but as to the main thing utterly careleſs: Their ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43094:53"/> the humour and cuſtom of the world may not be followed, let theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be ponder'd by you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The moſt in the world are blind.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, they are void of counſel, neither have they any underſtanding in them; <hi>they are not wiſe to conſider their latter end, Deut.</hi> 32. 28, 29. nor the worth of that gracious ſeaſon, in which alone preparation can be made for it. And ſhall we write after the Coppies which a company of fools ſet us? Shall we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the blind, that quickly will fall into the ditch, and have not eyes to ſee their danger?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The moſt are unbelieving; a froward generation, children, in whom there is no faith,</hi> and from this root of infidelity doth ſpring their prodigallity of the day of Grace. Did they indeed believe that death will not make an end of them, but that after this is finiſhed, another life will follow, either of the greateſt joy, or of as great ſorrow; and that joy or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the next world will be their lot, according as the preſent ſeaſon is, or is not improved; certainly they would be more ſparing of that which is ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43094:54"/> Oh the ſecret paganiſme that is in the hearts of multitudes! they live as if Eternity were a fiction, and Hell a fable; but will it be thought a fable, when they feel the tortures of it? And what ſhall we tread in the ſteps of ſuch Infidels? No, <hi>we are to follow,</hi> not the unbelief, but <hi>the faith of others,</hi> Heb. 13. 7. <hi>Whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </label> Let me perſwade all to a ſerious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this day of their gracious
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43094:54"/> viſitation. The Arguments to prevail are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This day is continually paſſing:</hi> Your glaſs is running every moment, whether you ſleep or wake, are in company or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, are vain or ſerious, do pray or ſin, it never ſtands ſtill: And when once your glaſs is run, 'twill never be turn'd again, but taken down immediately. Your dayes are but an hand-breadth; and whether of this hand-breadth there be an inch remaining, is a queſtion. <hi>Time</hi> is not unfitly <hi>pictur'd with wings,</hi> becauſe it flies ſo faſt away; and <hi>bald behind,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot catch hold of it to pull it back.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>You all muſt be reckoned with, how you have husbanded this gracious ſeaſon.</hi> Oh what a caſe will the ſlothful ſoul be in, when death gives him a ſummons; and he hears that word, <hi>Render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thy ſtewardſhip, for thou mayſt be no longer ſteward.</hi> Conſcience muſt needs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43094:55"/> very much amaze the ſinner, when it ſhall before the Judge bring in ſuch Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as theſe againſt him. <hi>So much of this day of ſavation was ſpent in immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate recreations: So much in carnal and ungodly company: So much in eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing after the deceitful riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world: So much in making proviſion for the fleſh, that the vile and baſe luſts of it might be fulfilled: So much in proud and towring imaginations: So much in amorous and filthy muſings: So much in vain and rotten communication: So much in Taverns, and Ale-houſes, and in the Harlots habitations: So much in tricking and adorning the body: And Chriſt and the ſoul were all the mean while neglected and forgotten. Often ask thy ſelf this queſtion;</hi> Do I ſpend my Day of Grace after ſuch a manner, as I may account for it at laſt with comfort? Such thoughts would make you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let the diligence of the earthly minded, in improving the worlds day, ſhame you out of your idleneſs in this day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vation.</hi> If the greedy tradeſman hears of an excellent b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>opportunities have followed thick one upon another, of getting grace, but none were laid hold upon: There was nothing I ſlighted more, then that which leaſt of all deſerv'd my ſlighting: Oh that my paſt dayes could be again recall'd, they ſhould be ſpent after another faſhion: But inſtead of that, what cauſe have I to fear, that the Lord may allow no more time, ſince that which he hath allowed hath been ſo unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably conſumed?</hi>

Muſt I go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to the Bar of God, who have nothing but provoked him all my dayes? May I not be ſpared a few years, or moneths, or weeks longer? Oh call time again; I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw thy worth till now: If I might be again recover'd and reſtored, oh how often would I pray, and how earneſtly would I cry for mercy and grace? how carefully would I hear and practiſe? But this I ſhould have done before, 'tis now too late to think—</hi>and there he ſtops, his thread is cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his ſoul flyes away, and leaves his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a clod of earth.</p>
            <p>And now Brethren, are your hearts ſtill maſtered? 'Tis to be hoped concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worſt in this Congregation, that their day is not quite gone; but who knows whether this may not be the laſt hour; and if now you will not, your own ſpirits may be quickly required of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43094:57"/> you, or Gods Spirit may depart from you. You will wiſh at laſt, as others have done, that the day of ſalvation had been valued, let it therefore be no more neglected.</p>
            <p>5. Conſider, <hi>If you will not improve the Day of Grace, you can reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing but a day of wrath.</hi> When mercy hath acted its part towards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones, and being ſtill refuſed, makes its <hi>Exit;</hi> then fury and indignation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the ſtage; but of that traged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there will be no end. Whole eternity will be taken up in feeling the effects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpleaſure, and in bewailing the loſs of that Day of Grace, wherein this anger might have been appeaſed.</p>
            <p>I have done with the ſecond Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The third follows: <hi>To know, in this Day of Grace, the things which belong to our peace, is our great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and wiſdom.</hi> If <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been thus wiſe, ſhe would not have been, as ſhe was, rejected. <hi>If thou hadſt known,</hi> ſayes Chriſt: The defective ſpeech is thus to be made up, If the things of thy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43094:57"/> peace had been underſtood by thee, O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thy ſtate would have been as happy as now 'tis woful; inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off, thou wouldſt have been ſtill as near to God and as dear as ever; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having his wrath poured out upon thee to the uttermoſt, that mercy, which hath been ſo often proffer'd, had aſſuredly been beſtowed, if thou hadſt not fooliſhly ſhut thy eyes, ſo as not to ſee either the value, or thy own need of mercy.

            <p> This is a ſubject no leſs profitable then pleaſant, <hi>Dulce nomen pacis,</hi> the name of peace hath a ſweet ſound. <hi>Peace</hi> implies a bleſſed conjunction between heaven and earth, between the Creator and us his creatures; and, which follows here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, a ſatisfaction and quietneſs in our hearts, ſo that thoſe diſturbances and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, which were cauſed by ſin, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed and regulated. The firſt of theſe, namely, Agreement with Heaven, is the principally intended peace, which Chriſt ſpeaks of; but the other, namely, Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within, follows upon this, and is the ſuperſtructure upon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore firſt explain the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Peace above,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Peace within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>There is a Peace with God above:</hi> When I ſpeak of peace with God, 'tis ſuppoſed that by nature God and we are at variance, and ſin is the make-bate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man. Sin is a thing that not only cauſes commotions and tumults here below; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>From whence comes war and fightings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you? comes it not hence, even of</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43094:58"/> 
               <hi>your luſts that war in your members? Jam.</hi> 4. 1. but it alſo ſets Heaven and Earth at odds; it ſo beſots the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherds of the earth, that they venture to contend with him that is their Maker, and who can eaſily daſh them all in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Sin hath ſet us at a vaſt diſtance from God, and is continually thruſting us further from him; yet we may have peace, if we will indeed return to him: Though we have provoked him to be an enemy, yet he is not ſuch an enemy as is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable: Hark what language he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27. 4, 5. <hi>Fury is not in me; let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me.</hi> Peace with God is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; God himſelf is ready to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us, that we may make peace with him, and the more abundantly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us, he ſayes, <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi> that is, towards them who are willing to be reconciled, and to rebel no more, he is not at all furious, but gracious and eaſie to be intreated, though their awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and fearful hearts are prone to imagine the Lord is made up all of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:43094:59"/>
            <p> This Peace with God, ſeveral thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are implied in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Peace with God implies <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of his wrath.</hi> All ſin is pardon'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thou haſt take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> away all thy wrath, thou haſt turned thy ſelf from the fierceneſs of thine anger.</hi> The flaming ſword is removed, and the Lord ſayes, <hi>Draw nigh to me, and I will draw nigh to you.</hi> We read, as of a Gulph fixed between God and damned ſpirits, ſo of a middle wall of partition between God and unregenerate ſinners; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, namely, the Gulph, indeed cannot be paſſed thorow; but the latter, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle wall, may be broken down, and 'tis broken down when our peace is made: His wrath abides on thoſe that will not believe, that refuſe to be reconciled; but his anger ceaſes towards them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and yield to him. Thrice happy
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43094:59"/> they, who are eaſed of ſuch a load as the wrath of God!</p>
            <p>Speak O ye troubled Conſciences, is not this anger your greateſt trouble, and that which makes the deepeſt wounds? Speak, O Hells Inhabitants, is not divine wrath a puniſhment too heavy for you to bear? is not this the weight which ſinks you loweſt in the bottomleſs pit? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hear what Chriſt ſpake when he felt the diſpleaſure of his Father, <hi>My Soul,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death.</hi> Well may they rejoyce, who through Jeſus are freed from this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Peace with God implies <hi>an intereſt in his love.</hi> His love is every whit as great towards thoſe who are at peace with him, as before his wrath was. We may ceaſe to be angry with another, and yet not have any great affection for him. But where the Lord turns away his wrath, the ſtream of his love doth run amain. The time of our reconcilation and returning is called <hi>a time of love:</hi> And this love is the more to be admired, becauſe it finds us in our bloud, which makes us deſerve loathing; it finds no
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43094:60"/> beauty, no comelineſs at all in us, but what it puts upon us. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>rich mercy,</hi> and <hi>great love,</hi> which the reconciled have an intereſt in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>But God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt: by grace ye are ſaved.</hi> This love of God is exceeding li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, it ſets open his fulneſs which is ſo all-ſufficient, and we may come, and take what we need at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And as they, who are at peace with God, have an intereſt in his love, ſo this love doth enkindle love in them to him again: The unreaſonable enmity of their hearts againſt God is cured; the ſoul lifts up it ſelf to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 1. which before very unreaſonably doated upon the world, and much more unreaſonably upon its own luſts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Peace with God implies <hi>the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a ſure and everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between him and us.</hi> As the Lord makes this Covenant, ſo he makes over himſelf in this Covenant; He becomes ours, and he takes us for his own, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 8. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w when I paſſed by thee, and</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:43094:60"/> 
               <hi>looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſs; yea, I ſware un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> This Covenant is ſtyled <hi>the Covenant of peace.</hi> The Lord being once a friend will never become an enemy; he will be merciful to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of them that are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him; and as he hath engaged not to leave and forſake them, ſo he hath promiſed to put his love and fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not leave and forſake him: they are apt to be unſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, 'tis well they have to do with a God that is faithful and changeth not; to this is owing their perſeverance and their bleſſedneſs. That's a ſweet place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54. 10. <hi>For the mountains ſhall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> Oh that our hearts were but ſet to ſtudy this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of our God! How precious, how ſutable are the Promiſes of it! We are guilty; defiled, troubled, weak and loſt creatures, but in this Covenant, Pardon,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43094:61"/> the Spirit, Peace, ſtrengthening Grace, and eternal Salvation are made over. And he that hath promiſed can as eaſily perform as promiſe. Nay, Chriſt hath confirmed this Covenant by his death, ſo that it cannot be altered. Our Lord at his death engaged his Father to be a Friend unto all that did or ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; and therefore that he will be a ſure and never failing Friend, may ſecurely be built upon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Peace with God implies, <hi>his taking us into a new and near relation to himſelf.</hi> He makes us his Children, and ſurely then we ſhall abide in his houſe for ever. He not only ſayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will be <hi>a God to you,</hi> but alſo, <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. Well may we wonder with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God!</hi> Thoſe who are at peace with God are eſpouſed unto Jeſus Chriſt, unto ſuch, a Bill of divorce ſhall never be given. And as Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their Husband, and God their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo they conſent to carry it like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43094:61"/> to love and fear the Lord in a child-like manner, to follow fully and hard after him; they are willing to be faithful unto Chriſt, and to be ſubject unto his commands, which are far from being grievous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Peace with God implies <hi>freedom of acceſs to him.</hi> Thoſe who proudly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves in ſin, the Lord beholds them afar off, but he is nigh to thoſe whoſe peace is made; ſuch are invited not only to come, <hi>but to come with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Throne of Grace;</hi> and mercy and grace to help ſhall not be denied them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> They may without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement approach to God, and tell him of their temptations; He is ready to ſuccour them: they may tell him of their weakneſs, he is ready to ſtrengthen them with might in their inward man; they may tell him of the diſtempers, which they are burthen'd with, he is ready to heal them; they may ſpread their deſires before him, he is ready to fulfil the deſire of the humble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:43094:62"/>
            <p> And as the Soul, whoſe peace is made hath freedom of acceſs to God, ſo God hath freedom of acceſs unto the ſoul. When Chriſt knocks, the heart opens; when the Spirit moves, he doth prevail; when God comes to dwell, the heart yields it ſelf to be his Temple and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and how much hereby is the ſoul dignified and advanced? The ſinner is no longer fooliſhly ſtubborn, he denies the Lord nothing; when he requires his heart, his deſire, his love, none of theſe ſhall be kept back any longer from him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Peace with God <hi>implies fellowſhip and communion with him.</hi> There is a kind of a <hi>commonneſs</hi> between God and them that are reconciled to him; whatever is in God is theirs, becauſe <hi>God is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be called their God,</hi> Heb. 11. 16. They have an intereſt and propriety in his Power, and Wiſdom, and Mercy, and fulneſs, and they are ſenſible of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed effects of theſe and other of the Lords Attributes. God having given them himſelf, what will he refuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate? He is ever manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and beſtowing thoſe bleſſings upon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43094:62"/> them, which Aliens never do receive. He deals not towards them with a ſparing hand; the promiſe runs thus, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81. 10. And this is certain, that the more open our mouths are, the more open will the hand of God be.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what Peace above, what Peace with God is.</p>
            <p>In the next place I am to ſpeak of Peace within.</p>
            <p>'Tis natural to man to be his own enemy and tormentor. He that was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with unclean ſpirits, 'tis ſaid no man could bind him, no not with chains, but he was in the Tombs and Mountains, crying and cutting himſelf with ſtones, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 5. In like manner, a child of diſobedience, in whom the Prince of the power of the Air worketh, will not be bound, will not be hindred from doing his ſoul harm; thoſe cords of reſtraint that the Word caſts upon him, he breaks aſunder and caſts away; he is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cutting and wounding his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and if he be not quickly tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this eſtate, he will quickly give himſelf the fatal blow. As long as any
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43094:63"/> are enemies to God, they are alſo their own adverſaries; but when they leave off fighting againſt God, they ceaſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Peace within is very comprehenſive, ſeveral things are therein included.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Peace within comprehends <hi>calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Conſcience:</hi> This calmneſs follows upon the apprehenſion and ſenſe of our peace with God, and that now he is in his Son reconciled. A reproaching Conſcience is a fearful companion; we cannot fly away from Conſcience, it is alwayes with us; if awakened 'twill ſpeak boldly, and tell us our own, be we never ſo proud or high in the world, and the ear is forced to hear Conſcience's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations; when God gives it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to ſpeak, how impoſſible is it for us to impoſe ſilence on it? Oh what a ſtorm doth the remembrance of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſins, with their manifold aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, raiſe in the Conſcience? how ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed is it to ſee ſo much guilt, and God ſo much and ſo juſtly incenſed? But when God by his Spirit doth ſay, <hi>Soul, though ſin hath abounded, my grace doth ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; thy debts are all paid, thy iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:43094:63"/> 
               <hi>are all pardoned,</hi> Then the ſtorm ceaſes, and there follows a great calm; Then Conſcience layes aſide the whip of ſteel, wherewith before it laſh'd it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Conſcience acquits the ſinner, becauſe God hath firſt juſtified and abſolved him. Sins which are paſt are remitted, and inſtead of continuing in ſin, the heart is changed, and is ſincerely deſirous to have it ſlain; and this godly ſincerity Conſcience gives teſtimony to, the effect of which is peace and joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience.</hi> Conſcience tells us of our duty, and urges us to the performance of it; now when Conſcience is heeded by us, and what we do for God our very hearts are in it, Conſcience will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, but approve us, and this will qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et us; for ſayes the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Peace within comprehends <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the heart. Solomon,</hi> while making trial what ſufficiency was in the things under the Sun, was far from peace within, vanity was the fruit of all his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43094:64"/> labour, and his ſpirit is ſo far from being ſatisfied, that 'twas filled with vexation. But when God doth give himſelf to us, whom our hearts muſt then needs look upon as a proportionable happineſs, as a ſufficient portion, oh then we are come to our centre, and are at reſt When the Soul ceaſes to tire and weary it ſelf in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the creatures, and is fixed upon God, who is a Sun, a Shield, an exceeding great Reward; who is the God of all grace, and calls us to eternal glory; who cannot only ſatiate our deſires, but do exceedingly above our deſires and thoughts, according to that power which worketh in us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 20. Then, then our peace abounds, and paſſes all underſtanding. The heart is exceedingly pleaſed with its choice, having made choice of God; it would not exchange conditions with the greateſt graceleſs ones in the whole world.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd indeed, that in this life only the back parts of the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> are ſeen, and little of him in compariſon is to be enjoyed: Yet this is certain, that <hi>Gods little</hi> is much more then the <hi>worlds all:</hi> The enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43094:64"/> of the Lord in part, affords more peace and ſatisfaction, by ten thouſand degrees, then the creatures are capable of yielding; and that ſatisfaction, how much is it heightned by the aſſured hopes, that at laſt we ſhall be fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Peace within comprehends <hi>an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in our wills to the will of God.</hi> 'Tis but reaſon, that ſince Gods will is ſo high, ſo holy, ſo good, our wills ſhould ſtoop and ſubmit; and we cannot have peace but in that ſubmiſſion. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity againſt God, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be ſubject to the Law and Word of God: Nay, by that very Law the corrupted heart is irritated and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, 'tis the more forward to ſin, becauſe forbidden to tranſgreſs: He was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with mans nature, who ſaid,
<q>Nitimur in vetitum ſemper, cupimuſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> negata.</q> We are very prone to do that which is forbidden, and to deſire what is denied us: And while the heart is thus irritated by the Law, alas! the ſinner is like the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43094:65"/> troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt: <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the commandment, doth work all manner of concupiſcence,</hi> Rom. 7. 8. But now what peace is there, when our hearts are reconciled to our duty, when we do not quarrel at, but love the Law, and wiſh, oh that our wayes were directed to keep it! How can there be peace within, unleſs there be ſome ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs between our ſpirits and Gods Word and Ordinances? unleſs what was before look'd upon, without cauſe, as a burthen and wearineſs, be now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd as a priviledge and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?</p>
            <p>Peace within comprehends <hi>ordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the affections.</hi> Our paſſions and affections, being corrupted by ſin, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tumultuous and unruly; and except theſe are tamed and brought into right order, we ſhall not know peace. Thoſe are ſome of the worſt kind of ſlaves that are enſlaved by their own affections. How is that man hurried, who is under the power of worldly or unclean deſires? His fleſhly and his worldly luſts do ſo take up his time and pains, that they will not permit him to eat, or drink, or ſleep,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43094:65"/> and much leſs pray in quiet. How is that heart rent and torn, that is by inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate love glued to any creature, when of that creature 'tis deprived? Oh the overwhelming ſorrow which follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on love that is exceſſive! What a rack and torture is anger? What an evil is fear? many times worſe then the evil feared: And ſo I might inſtance in other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>If the world be compared to a Stage, and the life of man to a part which he acts upon it, we may truly ſay, that a wicked man doth act, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the part of a <hi>Self-puniſher,</hi> becauſe by giving way to his corrupt affections, he contributes ſo much to his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
            <p>But 'tis the work of the Spirit of God to renew theſe affections; the anger and ſorrow are turned againſt and on ſin, the love and the deſire are towards God: And as here there is no danger of exceſs, ſo there is a certainty of enjoyment: The heart ſits looſe from the world, and the world is not able to diſturb that peace which it hath in God. None are more free from trouble then thoſe that are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43094:66"/> moſt maſters of their own affections: And well may the Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is peace and joy,</hi> Gal. 5. 22. ſince he brings our affections into captivity.</p>
            <p>5. Peace within comprehends <hi>a ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be our own foes.</hi> When are we our own foes? Surely when we ſide with Satan againſt our ſelves, when we cheriſh thoſe luſts that war againſt our own ſouls. The Vipers off-ſpring do eat out the Vipers bowels; and ſinful luſts, in like manner, will deſtroy at laſt thoſe in whom they are bred and foſter'd. Oh let us all be reconciled to our ſelves, and not continue any longer the greateſt acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to our own miſery.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed now what Peace is.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place I am to manifeſt what are the things which belong unto our peace.</p>
            <p>'Tis in the Goſpel that theſe things are revealed, which therefore is called the Goſpel of Peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things.</hi> Herein is contained an Embaſſage of reconciliation: The God
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43094:66"/> of peace proclaims to the world what an inclination he hath to be a friend and a Saviour to the children of men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms them upon what articles a peace ſhall be made and eſtabliſhed between him and them. The Law of Nature is here ſilent; the Heathens by the light of that could never find out the way, how Divine Juſtice may be ſatisfied, and an attonement for ſin made. Nay, the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law of God ſpeaks not a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: The Law teacheth our duty, convinceth of tranſgreſſion, thunders out curſes againſt tranſgreſſours, and they would be left under the curſe, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel did not tell them how to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, and how Grace, and Mercy, and Peace may be obtained.</p>
            <p>There are three things which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel reveals concerning our peace.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Who is the Mediatour or Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>What are the conditions of this Peace.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>How we may attain to an aſſurance of it.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. One thing which we muſt know concerning our peace, is, <hi>Who is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:43094:67"/> 
               <hi>or Peace-maker between God and men, and he is Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> Here it was that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was ignorant; a cruclfied <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> (though his crucifixion was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his making of our peace) they hid their faces from, and diſeſteemed. Chriſt crucified was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but to them that are reconciled and ſaved, he is the power of God, and the wiſdom of God: Hence 'tis, that the Apoſtle reſolves to know nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him. All things that are revealed in Scripture muſt be known with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, elſe our knowledge will be uncomfortable and without advantage.</p>
            <p>What good will it do us to hear that God is gracious and merciful, unleſs in Chriſt he be reconciled? what good, to be informed of heaven and glory, unleſs Chriſt, who hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> do open the door that we may enter? What good, to hear of the Promiſes, unleſs in Chriſt they be Yea and Amen to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43094:67"/> of God? Finally, what will it benefit us to hear of the priviledges of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, unleſs through Chriſt we are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them? There is an excellency in the knowledge of Chriſt our Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, in compariſon of which the Apoſtle counted all things but loſs and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>Chriſt Jeſus is our Peace-maker by a threefold means. His <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,</hi> and <hi>the communication of his benefits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Chriſt Jeſus is our Peace maker by <hi>means of his ſatisfaction:</hi> For the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his people was he ſmitten, and the chaſtiſement of their peace was laid upon him: He was ſent on purpoſe to be a propitiation; 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and ſent his Son to be the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins.</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto God, by the bloud of his Croſs, and to have ſlain the enmity thereby. Corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, were inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but the bloud of Chriſt was a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent price for our redemption.</p>
            <p>We may conceive ſuch a kind of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43094:68"/> as this, between Juſtice, and Chriſt, and Man who hath offended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Divine Juſtice thus begins: <hi>Bring forth the Soul which hath ſinned that it may dye: A righteous Law hath been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and 'tis but righteous that the curſe ſhould be inflicted: Here are not one, or two, but thouſands of ſins upon record: Now therefore I am reſolved to whet my glittering ſword, and my hand ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately take hold on vengeance, and I'll make the ſinner know to his coſt, what 'tis to provoke the Lord to jealouſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt anſwers; <hi>Hold Juſtice, ſtay thy hand! thoſe ſins thou ſpeakeſt of, they are transferred unto another, therefore the Soul muſt not dye that's guilty of them: The debt is great, but I undertake to pay it all; where thou art wronged, it ſhall be put wholly on my account, I am reſolved to be the ſinners Surety, I am content to be made ſin for him, though I knew none, though I never was my ſelf in the leaſt guilty</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Unto this Juſtice replyes, <hi>Then, O thou Son of God, I muſt ſheath my ſword in thy bowels, I muſt wound, and bruiſe, and afflict thee: where ever I find ſin, though</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:43094:68"/> 
               <hi>but imputed,</hi> I <hi>can't for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear to puniſh it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſt anſwers again; <hi>Do Juſtice, ſtrike, and ſpare not; I am willing to be wounded, that the ſinners wounds may be cloſed and cured; I am willing to dye that be may live; I am willing to undergo the curſe, that he may receive the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon this the ſinner wonders and cryes out, <hi>Oh love that paſſeth knowledge! My Lord, my Saviour! ſince thou haſt giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thy life a ranſom for me, I am reſolved to truſt in thee, and to lay the ſtreſs of my ſalvation on thee; I expect and deſire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and pardon no other way, then by thee, who art both the Price and the Prince of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Chriſt is our Peace-maker <hi>by means of his interceſſion.</hi> As his ſatisfaction is one, ſo his interceſſion is the other part of his Prieſtly office. He ſeconds his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings by his interceſſion; and we may be confident his interceſſion will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, becauſe of that love which his Father bears him, and becauſe by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he hath purchaſed whatever he intercedes for. <hi>Chriſt the righteous is our</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:43094:69"/> 
               <hi>Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 John 2. 1. He preſents before his Father the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of his ſatisfaction, and how he hath endured the Croſs and ſhame, and drank off that whole Cup which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put into his hand, and fulfilled all righteouſneſs; how he did, and ſuffered all that was required of him, and all this, not for himſelf, but us. Whereupon the Father looks upon us with an eye of love, he is pacified towards us; and as he is Chriſts God and Father, ſo he is ours too: <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Go tell my brethren, I aſcend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt is our Peace-maker <hi>by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his benefits:</hi> He is made unto us wiſdom, and then we ſee the way of reconciliation: He is made unto us righteouſneſs; ſin is no longer imputed, and that quarrel which Juſtice had with us comes to an end: He is made unto us ſanctification, and then the holineſs of God ceaſes to be our enemy, and we no longer hate that holineſs; there is a ſweet agreement between our renewed nature and an holy God, and his holy Law, which he would have us walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43094:69"/> to. They that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, love God becauſe of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and they love the Word of God upon the ſame ſcore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 139, 140. <hi>My zeal hath conſumed m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe mine enemies have forgotten thy words: Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> Finally, Chriſt is made unto us redemption, that's a fourth benefit rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. He makes us free indeed, becauſe he frees us from that which is ſlavery indeed, he delivers us from the bondage of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cauſes us to become the ſervants of God and righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. And now we are reconciled to Gods Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Authority, we own him as our Lord, who as he hath right to rule us, ſo 'tis our honour, our advancement, our freedom to be ruled by him.</p>
            <p>2. As we muſt know who is our Peace-maker, ſo what are the conditions of our peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One condition is <hi>godly ſorrow:</hi> And as the Lord doth grant us peace, ſo he himſelf doth work this and the other conditions of it. If we will be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we muſt mourn for our offending
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43094:70"/> and provoking God to be an enemy. The eye of the body can look every way but inward, and ſhall the eye of our mind never look inward neither? Were our hearts but more acquainted with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would be more broken and contrite hearts: How deeply is the Law of ſin engraven there? and this Law of ſin forbids whatever the Law of God commands, and commands whatever the Law of God forbids. The moſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous creature is not more full of poyſon, then our hearts are full of enmity againſt the Lord, and reprobateneſs to what is good: This corruption of our nature is not a thing which hath layn dormant and idle; no, but as a Fountain perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſends forth water, ſo from the heart proceed evils abundantly, whereby the man is defiled. 'Tis difficult to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up the ſins of one day, or of one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and how vaſt then is the total ſum of our whole lives abominations? Oh break hard heart for ſhame! who haſt ſo often broken the moſt equal laws, and broken thorow ſo many obligations to obedience. If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> offending God be made light of, this will anger him more then all thy other offences.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:43094:70"/> 2. Another condition of our Peace is <hi>Believing.</hi> When the Jaylour was under the ſenſe of Gods anger and wrath, and tortur'd with the fears of damnation, and cry'd out, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved? Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> made this anſwer, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31. How much is faith preached up in the Goſpel? and unto Chriſt our faith is directed, for 'tis in him that God is well pleaſed, and 'tis through that beloved Son alone, that he will be at peace, and well pleaſed with us: If we expect favour or mercy any other way, but through Jeſus, that very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation is ſufficient to be an eternal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to our obtaining of either. The Lord hath made Faith one great condition of our peace and ſalvation, for two reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Man being thus reconciled and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by believing, <hi>all the glory redounds to God alone:</hi> Mans boaſting is utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: The hand of faith is an empty hand, it brings nothing along with it; but it receives Chriſt, <hi>and with him, and from him, freely all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngs.</hi> Faith exalts Chriſt, and abaſes the ſinner, and makes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43094:71"/> him ſee, that he is wretched, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and poor, and naked, and that to Chriſt he muſt be beholding for every thing, he muſt thank himſelf for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Man being thus reconciled and ſaved by believing, his peace with God is laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his ſalvation ſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure. Adam</hi> was at peace with God when firſt created; but ſince the continuance of his peace depended upon the conſtancy of his obedience, peace and life were ſoon loſt by him. But faith puts our peace and ſalvation in the hands of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the hands of Chriſt, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to be <hi>the finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. He hath promiſed to keep us from falling, and <hi>to confirm us to the end,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 8. And the believer reſts upon this word of promiſe, which will never fail him.</p>
            <p>That's the ſecond condition of peace, believing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another condition is; <hi>Converſion with the whole heart to God.</hi> How often doth the Spirit cry out, <hi>Turn and live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:43094:71"/> And though the Lord was bitterly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, yet upon his peoples returning, he promiſes to be pacified, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Go and proclaim theſe words towards the North, and ſay, Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and</hi> I <hi>will not cauſe my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever.</hi> Our returning to him muſt be without delay, without deceit; we muſt not divide our hearts between him and ſin, between him and Mammon, but we muſt conſent to be <hi>wholly his,</hi> and never to leave him any more; but if through infirmity we do fall, we muſt look unto the Lord to pity, and pardon, and heal, and raiſe us. To turn away from God ſo as not to return, is inconſiſtent with peace. Thus you know theſe things, which are the conditions of your peace; let me add, <hi>Happy are ye if ye do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It concerns us to know, <hi>how we may attain to an aſſurance of Peace.</hi> The ſoul indeed may be ſafe without this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, but withall 'twill be diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Now 'tis the Spirit who makes this diſcovery: We read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>of peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Peace
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43094:72"/> and joy are the fruits of this bleſſed Comforter. In Scripture the Saints are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. And their being thus ſealed, as it denotes their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the reſt of the world, their being appropriated unto God, and the value that is put upon them; ſo it ſerves to confirm them in that perſwaſion, That God is theirs, and they are his. There is indeed a privy Seal of his gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the Spirit works upon us, we are ſealed in a more diſcernable way. Now the work and method of the Spirit in ſealing and bringing thoſe, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, unto an aſſurance of peace, I ſhall declare.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spitit convinces us of ſin and miſery, of our worthleſneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bows our hearts to a ſubmiſſion to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and draws us to a cloſure with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirit ſanctifies and cleanſes us from the filthineſs, in which we wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43094:72"/> and cauſes us to yield obedience to the commands of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Spirit doth more and more ſtir up and increaſe the grace which he he hath wrought, ſo that the actings of faith, and love, and hope, and zeal, are the more ſtrong and ſenſible.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirit doth diſcover the truth of theſe graces, letting us ſee, that our hearts do prize Chriſt, and breath after God, and after a greater degree of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, as the Saints in Scripture have done before us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then peace and joy follows. But here we muſt underſtand, that this peace is twofold. Firſt, more weak, mixed and imperfect. Secondly, more raviſhing, glorious and triumphant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a peace <hi>more weak, mixed and imperfect,</hi> which is for our ſupport and encouragement, and this is common with believers, when they ſtir up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſeek the Lord with their whole deſire, as they did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 15. Seldom is a duty performed with our heart and might, but ſome degree of peace and ſatisfaction follows, the Spirit giving ſome intimation, and raiſing a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43094:73"/> hope, that God through Chriſt doth accept of us. Oh who would not labour ſince there is ſuch peace and reſt attends it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a peace <hi>more raviſhing, glorious, and triumphing.</hi> How brightly doth the light of Gods countenance then ſhine upon us! How ſweet is that love, the ſenſe of which the Spirit ſheds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the heart! <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence have we then in God! How do we admire the richneſs of his grace! how low are we in our own eyes, being aſtoniſhed that ſuch vile creatures ſhould be ſo advanced! How do we then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the worlds delights, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin! How forward are we to obey, and to walk in all Ordinances blameleſs! How undaunted at danger, and at death, which will but increaſe our pleaſures, ſending us much nearer to the Lord, then here we are capable of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching! Thus 'tis by the Spirit that peace is ſpoken to us; and if we would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this peace, we muſt heed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits counſels, we muſt readily cloſe with his motions, we muſt gladly accept of his help and aſſiſtance, we muſt give up our ſelves unto his guidance.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:43094:73"/>
            <p> In the third place follow the reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Why, to know the things of our peace is our great happineſs and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The reaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>a true knowledge of theſe things will be practical and induſtrious;</hi> It will very much affect the heart, and quicken diligence, in ſeeking peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late: A right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, will hinder a buſineſs of ſuch eternal conſequence, from being any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger neglected by us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>of the evil which unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follows, if of the things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our peace we are ignorant.</hi> The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſoul is wretchedly careleſs, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not whether God be a friend or foe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Look unto me, who am the God of love and peace: The creatures have but empty breaſts, are but broken ciſterus; but I have ſtore of living waters to quench thy thirſt, and ſatisfie thy longing: Sin is the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thy peace, therefore let ſin be caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with hatred, and trouble, that ever thou didſt give it entertainment.

            <p>2. Another leſſon which we may learn is this, <hi>The wretchedneſs of the ungodly, for there is no peace to them;</hi> Iſai. 57. 21. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, unto the</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:43094:76"/> 
               <hi>wicked.</hi> And the more wicked, the leſs peace, and the longer you continue wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the leſs hopes that ever there will be any. I grant indeed, that 'tis ordinary for wicked ones to cry peace to themſelves, but this falſe and imaginary peace is as bad, nay worſe, then none at all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The peace of the wicked <hi>is founded upon ignorance;</hi> they know not what cauſe they have to fear and be troubled, the ſins which they commit, the God whom they every hour provoke, and the vengeance unto which they are liable, is not in all their thoughts: <hi>Theſe things they are willingly ignorant of,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This peace of the wicked, <hi>many times 'tis the conſequent of judicial hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> their eyes are ſhut, their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are caſt into a dead ſleep, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come paſt feeling; no wonder if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a kind of quiet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This peace of the wicked <hi>is a great hindrance to their obtaining of true peace:</hi> while they imagine their ſtate is good and ſafe enough, they will not ſeek to have it alter'd; by means of this the ſtrong man armed doth keep the houſe in more quiet and ſecure poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:43094:76"/> 4. This peace of the wicked <hi>is but of very ſhort continuance;</hi> 'tis chaſed away like a pleaſant dream or night viſion, and the ſucceeding wo and trouble will be the more intollerable, becauſe unlookt for it will come upon them.</p>
            <p>A peace the wicked have, but 'tis without ground, and worſe then none: True peace what have they to do with, as long as the wickedneſſes, which are practiſed, delighted in, and pleaded for, are ſo many?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ungodly have no peace in life.</hi> The Lord is their enemy, he hates them, is angry with them, walks contrary to them. Hark how he proclaims war, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I even am againſt thee, and I will execute judgments in the midſt of thee.</hi> And as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> So the words may be inverted, If God be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, what doth it ſignifie who is for us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Much leſs have the ungodly any peace at death. The end of the perfect and upright is peace; but the tranſgreſſours ſhall be deſtroyed together, the end of the wicked</hi>

               <hi>ſhall be cut off, Pſal.</hi> 37. 37, 38 Then their hopes will prove a Spiders web, their confidence as the giving up of the ghoſt. Perhaps when the ſnares of death are upon them, the pains of hell may get hold of them, Conſcience may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, and they may be like wild Bulls in a net, full of the fury of the Lord, and the rebuke of God: But if they dye ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, there is the leſs hope; if there are no bands in their death, 'tis the more certain they will be bound immediately after, and thrown into the lake of fire.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Judge will not find the ungodly in peace:</hi> No, no, they were not diligent or deſirous to be cleanſed from their ſpots and filthineſs. How many ſins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of will accompany them to the Tribunal? which will prove them ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, and which with a lowd united voice will cry for vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>And will they find any peace in hell into which with a curſe they muſt depart?</hi> Can there be any eaſe, any reſt taken in thoſe devouring flames? How many things will the damned have to trouble
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43094:77"/> them? All the wrath of God ſtirr'd up againſt them: The glory of his power manifeſting it ſelf in their deſtruction: The reflections of Conſcience upon the proffers of peace and life, which were once made, but madly, ſottiſhly deſpiſed, and which ſhould never, never be made more: Oh how will they be troubled, and bowed down, and mourn, and wail, and weep eternally!</p>

               <label>USE II. <hi>Of Exhortation to the Lords Enemies.</hi>
               </label> O that you would be perſwaded unto peace! Many arguments I may fill my mouth with, to prevail with you to be reconciled.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do but conſider ſeriouſly, <hi>what kind of enemy the Lord is,</hi> and that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration will make you afraid, that he ſhould be your enemy any longer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You cannot fly from his reach.</hi> Though you exalt your ſelves as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, though you ſet your neſt among the Stars, yet from thence the Lord can bring you down, <hi>Obad.</hi> 4. Though you ſhould go down to the bottom of the Sea, and

If you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that any refuge can ſecure you from God, that refuge will be found a lye, and will deceive you. The Lord does fill both heaven and earth, nay the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him, how then is it poſſible any ſhould fly from him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You cannot reſiſt his power.</hi> Far ſtronger creatures then you, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to withſtand the God of heaven: The Dragon fought and his Angels, but how eaſily were they overcome? After that <hi>Jehu</hi> had ſlain <hi>Joram</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> we read that the Elders of <hi>Samaria were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly afraid, and ſaid, behold two Kings ſtood not before him, how then ſhall we ſtand?</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 4: So may I ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Angels that excel in ſtrength, ſtood not before the Lord, he caſt them, when they ſinned, into chains, which they can never break aſunder; And how then ſhall man be able to ſtand, who dwelleth in a houſe of clay, whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in the duſt, and who is cruſhed before the moth?

And if a little be ſo intollerable, what will the whole weight be? The Prophet brings in the unſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, as if they had ſenſe, fearing and quaking, when the Lord doth ſhew his wrath, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his preſence, yea, the world and all that dwell therein; who can ſtand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceneſs of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi> Surely that heart is worſe then rocky, which doth not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He can engage all the creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.</hi> He is the Maker and alſo the great Commander of the Hoſt of Heaven and Earth. The Angels are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

And ſince he is <hi>Jehova Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> the Lord of ſuch Armies, Oh do not enter into battel with him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>He hath acceſs unto your very ſpirits, and can wound and fill your ſouls with horrour.</hi> When the Lord impreſſed his anger upon the heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> how reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was he? though a covetous man, he flings away his ſilver, <hi>that</hi> would not eaſe him; his life is a burthen, and with his own hands he puts an end to it. <hi>A wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit who can bear?</hi> and wounds <hi>there</hi> the Lord can give you.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>His power will reach his enemies in the next world:</hi> Nay, then his hand will be heavieſt of all; God will lay on load upon his adverſaries, and not in the leaſt ſpare them: His patience will then be at an end, his goodneſs totally and eternally
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43094:79"/> withdrawn; and how low then will his vengeance weigh them down? Such an enemy the Lord is, and this is one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſwade you to peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be mindful of the dependance you have upon him.</hi> In him you live, and move, and have your being, and if he ſhould withdraw his viſitation, your life would preſently conclude and vaniſh: And is it ſafe, or a wiſe part in you, to provoke that God to be your enemy, in whoſe hand your breath is, and who can take it out of your noſtrils when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? He can looſe the ſilver cord, he can break the golden bowl, and require your ſouls at your hands, without giving you an hours or a minutes warning. Whoſoever you fall out with, methinks you ſhould get and keep in with God, for 'tis his patience and mercy which keeps you out of the grave and hell; of both which, by reaſon of ſin, you are in great danger.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The condeſcenſion and ſtooping of God is admirably great, in beſeeching ſuch as you to be reconciled:</hi> And ſhall he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in vain? Shall the malefactour be beſeeched to accept of a pardon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43094:80"/> it? That is a text that ſhould work upon the moſt refractory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you, in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> What is it come to this, doth God beſeech, and Chriſt pray, that we, who are ſo mean and ſo vile, would be friends, and ſhall we continue rebels? <hi>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord!</hi> for the impenitent, then the earth or ſtones, are much more ſtupid. To ſlight the proffer of mercy, and to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the command to come for it, is both a fault and a folly inexcuſable; but to be deaf to intreaties, is worſt of all; this; goes neareſt unto God, when his conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and kindneſs is diſregarded and abuſed, and upon this abuſe the greater contempt, and anger, and hatred muſt needs follow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider what kind of friend the Lord is.</hi> I might be large in deſcribing his excellencies, which they who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him ſee and admire. Three things at preſent I ſhall mention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is ſuch a friend, <hi>whoſe love is tranſcendent.</hi> That ſweet name (which

And though the Lord hath ſupplyed the wants of all them, whom he hath made his friends from the beginning, yet his ſtock and ſtore is not at all diminiſhed; His wiſdom is never poſed in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulties; when believers know not what to do, and their eyes are unto him, he knows what to do for them: His power can raiſe them out of the loweſt deep; his all-ſufficiency can give
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43094:81"/> to the uttermoſt of their deſires, nay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly more then it hath entred into their hearts to deſire or conceive: Who in his wits would not leave a vain world, and deceitful luſts, to come to ſuch a friend as God hath alwayes ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be?</p>
            <p n="3">3. God is ſuch a friend, <hi>as will laſt when all other friends fail.</hi> He is the Lord who changes not: He can as ſoon ceaſe to be, as ceaſe to be faithful; and the faithfulneſs of God towards his friends, will make them alſo faithful; he will not turn away from them, and he will hold them faſt that they ſhall not depart from him. The Lord is moſt conſtant; the Ordinances of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars are not ſo immutable as the Promiſes he hath made. <hi>Men of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are vanity, men of high degree are a lye, Pſal.</hi> 62. 9. But God is true: Wealth may take wings and fly away, proſperity may vaniſh ſo as to be forgotten, fleſh and heart may fail, but the Lord will be a friend and a portion for ever. Oh conſent to be reconciled, ſince ſuch a friend here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will be gained.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider, <hi>If God be at peace with</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:43094:81"/> 
               <hi>you, he will ſhield you from all other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries;</hi> he will wreſt thoſe weapons out of your own hands, whereby you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured your own deſtruction; he will give a deaths wound to ſin, that it ſhall not be your death. And though the world, and the God of the world, fight againſt you, they ſhall not be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: Nay, their very enmity ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend you, <hi>and God will turn to good what they do mean for evil.</hi> 'Tis admirable to conſider, how the adverſaries of the Lords people, though they have the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion</hi> of enemies, yet are forced to <hi>act</hi> like friends, and do a kindneſs unto Saints by thoſe means, whereby they thought to have injured and deſtroyed them. Juſt as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren, when they would hinder his promotion, ſold their brother into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to that honour, which being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told was the matter of their envy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Gods late diſpenſations, in a way of judgment, do call upon you aloud to ſue for peace.</hi> He hath diſplayed his Flag of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, and the Motto of it hath been, <hi>Peſte, Ferro, &amp; Flamma, By Plague, and Sword, and Fire;</hi> By all theſe the Lord
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43094:82"/> hath been fighting with us and our ſins, and rebelling againſt him is the ground of the quarrel. The Sword was drawn, which devoured fleſh, and dyed red the Sea with bloud. The Quiver was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and out flew the Arrows of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and what ſlaughter did thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows make? Heaps upon heaps the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer kill'd, many thouſand went down to the Chambers of Death. We were ready to conclude, when the Plague was over, that God had done with us, but we were miſtaken: A Fire was kindled in his wrath, which the ſtrongeſt, the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt buildings could not ſtand againſt: How did the flames roar? what havock did they make? In three dayes ſpace, <hi>London</hi> was no more like it ſelf, then the dead bones, which have lay'n in the grave for ſeveral years, are like unto the man, when he was alive, and in his greateſt ſtrength and beauty.</p>
            <p>When theſe effects of his diſpleaſure are look'd upon with a conſiderate eye, who can doubt that God was angry? and how little hath been done to appeaſe his wrath? 'Tis high time to beg for mercy, and to abandon whatever is a bar
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43094:82"/> in Mercy's way. Oh that <hi>London,</hi> oh that <hi>England,</hi> would know the things that belong to their peace! We are not brought ſo low but we may be brought lower, if we provoke the Lord to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill an enemy.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Conſider, <hi>as yet there is a poſſibility of being reconciled to God:</hi> His Arms are open and ſtretched forth, if you will but caſt your ſelves into them: If the moſt wicked will but forſake their wayes and thoughts, and return to the Lord, he will have mercy upon them; and though ſin hath abounded, he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 7. Oh what would the damned give, that mercy were but poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be obtained? 'Tis great mercy that you have not ſinn'd your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of mercy: But if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God and peace with him be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, how quickly may you be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under ſin and wrath, and your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation become as impoſſible, as is the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe who are in Hell?</p>
            <p>I hope by this time your ears will be readily open to hearken to ſome Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how you may have your peace with God made.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:43094:83"/>
            <p> The Directions are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be ſenſible of, and bewail that enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is between God and you.</hi> You have unnaturally rebelled and riſen up againſt your Father that made you. Thoſe members which he formed, you have yielded as weapons of unrighteouſneſs; thoſe powers which he hath indued your ſouls with, you have employed ſinfully: You have diſhonoured him in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſpirits, whereas you ſhould have glorified him in both. You are unjuſtly and unreaſonably the Lords enemies; what hath he done to deſerve your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred? for which of his kindneſſes do you fight againſt him? But the Lord is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an enemy to you, becauſe your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions againſt him have been ſo many and ſo mighty. That you ſhould have hearts alienated from ſuch a God, ſo holy and gracious, and to whom you owe all that you are and have, it ſhould make your hearts break and melt within you; and that you have engaged this God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, ſhould be eſteemed an evil and a bitter thing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let your cryes be ſtrong for peace:</hi> Reſolve never to give over, till he whom
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43094:83"/> you have provoked to be your enemy, is become your friend. If you would have an intereſt in the favour of God, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour muſt be intreated, and that with your whole heart: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 58. <hi>I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated thy favour with my whole heart; be merciful to me according unto thy word.</hi> The condemned priſoner at the bar, if there be hopes of ſpeeding, how doth he implore the Judges mercy? The beggar, who is ready to ſtarve for hunger, how doth he make a noiſe, <hi>Bread, bread, for the Lords ſake, bread!</hi> And you have more cauſe to cry for peace with God; for if you live and dye enemies, you are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly undone. And to hearten you to prayer, let that Scripture be conſider'd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 5. <hi>For thou Lord art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them that call upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The mediation of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be uſed.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That Chriſt came and preached to them which were far off, and to them which were nigh,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12. that is, both to the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: And that peace which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by his bloud he purchaſed The bloud of Chriſt hath a voice, which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43094:84"/> voice is loud, and peace is the thing which his bloud cryes for. You muſt expect peace no other way but by the bloud of the Croſs. Believe that this bloud of Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, is ſufficient to make an atonement for your ſin; and being encouraged by the proffers and promiſes which he hath made in the Goſpel, be ſure to truſt in him, to be your Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he will not fail to mediate your peace; who ever believed on him and was confounded? Chriſt is ſtyled the <hi>Prince of Peace, Iſai.</hi> 9. 6. which ſhews that he hath an uncontroulable power to make peace, when, and for whom he pleaſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let the deſign of God in the Goſpel be conſider'd as matter of encouragement:</hi> which deſign is to reconcile the world unto himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 19. <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſpaſſes to them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> One great thing which keeps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If the Lord were ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to kill and deſtroy, why hath he provided a City of refuge? why did he refuſe to ſpare his Son? why doth he proclaim himſelf a God abundant in loving kindneſs, goodneſs and truth, who hath mercy for thouſands, and forgives iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin? The more firmly you are perſwaded of his kindneſs and compaſſions, the ſooner you will yield to him.</p>

            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:43094:85"/>
            <p> Here I ſhall, firſt, <hi>Lay down ſome ſigns of that peace which is true.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Some arguments to perſwade believers to endeavour after an aſſurance of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Signs are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>True peace follows after contrition and trouble for ſin.</hi> Thou art at peace; but waſt thou ever troubled? if not, 'twere well if thy peace were gone, and trouble in the room of it. Thou art trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at thy temporal loſſes, and when thy expectation from the creatures is fruſtrated; affliction alſo is troubleſom, and acknowledg'd an evil, but were thine eyes open to ſee the evil of ſin? was thy heart ever troubled for it? If guilt be made light of, if future puniſhment be not thought on, nor feared, if thou art unſenſible that ſin is a plague, and 'tis not noyſom to thee, if thy offending of God be the ſmalleſt matter of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, as long as thou feeleſt nothing of his hand, certainly thou waſt never bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo thy peace is not thy privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but thy puniſhment. Chriſt <hi>was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed to bind up the broken-hearted, and to comfort th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe who firſt have mourned, Iſai.</hi> 61. 1. and thoſe who have true reſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43094:86"/> given them, were firſt weary and heavy laden.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>True peace is the fruit of the lips.</hi> Iſai. 57. 9. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near.</hi> Peace is called the fruit of the lips, partly becauſe 'tis obtained by prayer, partly becauſe 'tis grounded upon the Goſpel which is preached to us: Where true peace is, there hath been a crying and lifting up the voice for it. Oh what importunities have been uſed, that the Lord would ceaſe to be an adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? what wreſtlings for his favour and friendſhip? This peace hath been valued above all the world, and the ſoul hath been contented to do any thing, to be any thing, ſo it may be at peace with God.</p>
            <p>True peace is likewiſe grounded upon the word; 'tis a peace not of our own, but of the Lords ſpeaking, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace to his people, and to his Saints, but let them not turn again to folly.</hi> And when he ſpeaks peace, who then can make trouble? The word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the marks and characters of ſuch
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43094:86"/> as are indeed reconciled unto God, and become his children; that they prize the Lord Jeſus above all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. that they hunger and thirſt after holineſs and righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6. that they love and fear, and are deſirous to follow their Father, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 1. And the Spirit by the Word doth work theſe gracious qualities and inclinations in our hearts, and diſcovers that he hath wrought them; and ſo we come to conclude that we are indeed reconciled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>True peace is joyned with the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual combat.</hi> The Spirit luſts againſt the fleſh in all thoſe who are reconciled unto God. There is a war with ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a peace with God. If any of our luſts, which are both the Lords enemies and our own too, are winked at, and proviſion is made for them that they may be fulfilled, we plainly ſhew we are ſtill alienated from him. But if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of corruption, if that evil which is preſent with us, be our burthen, and makes us cry out, <hi>O wretched as we are; Rom.</hi> 7. 24. and we would eſteem it one of the greateſt happineſſes, to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of that ſin that dwells in us, this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43094:87"/> ſhews evidently, <hi>that with our minds we ſerve the Law of God, that we are in Chriſt Jeſus, and there is no condemnation to us, Rom.</hi> 7. 25. and 8. 1.</p>
            <p>I grant, that in a wicked man there may be a combat between his will and his conſcience: Conſcience may check and reproach him, for what his will hath a ſtrong propenſion towards. But the combat between the fleſh and Spirit is another thing: Here the very heart and will is renewed, holineſs is longed after, ſin, not only becauſe of its guilt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its filth, a burthen; and the heart is deſirous that conſcience were more awakened, that it might exerciſe greater power, and cauſe a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from what is evil; whereas the deſire of unrenewed ones is, that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when troubled, may be huſht aſleep, that ſo ſin may be committed without any remorſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>True peace is inconſiſtent with care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs walking.</hi> A Child of God, who hath attained unto peace, if he grows looſe, and begins to live at random, preſently his peace withers, and conſcience grudges and is unſatisfied, eſpecially if temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43094:87"/> to ſin, that hath more of preſumption, doth prevail. Canſt thou omit thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? canſt thou be proud and peeviſh? canſt thou be exceſſive in thy recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? canſt thou be unwatchful over thy heart, and words, and wayes, and yet thy peace not at all abate? Aſſure thy ſelf thy peace is but a meer deluſion.</p>
            <p>The quicknings of the Spirit may be without the comforts, but never the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts without the quicknings. If thou grieveſt the Spirit by thy lukewarmneſs and formality to withdraw his aſſiſtance, and to leave thee under deadneſs, and thy peace ſtill remains, that peace is not the Spirits fruit, but thy own hearts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>Thus of the ſigns of peace.</p>
            <p>Now follows the arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade unto endeavours after aſſurance that your peace is made,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Aſſurance of peace will inflame your hearts with love.</hi> How will the fire kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and your hearts burn within you, when you perceive, that you, even you in particular, have an intereſt in that love which paſſes knowledge? that God hath had thoughts of kindneſs and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43094:88"/> you, before the foundation of the world was laid, and that as his love is from everlaſting, ſo to everlaſting it will endure? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. <hi>We love him,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> And this manifeſtation and ſenſe of the love of God will have the greater influence, becauſe it uſually finds us in ſorrow, doubting whether ever favour will be extended towards ſuch as we, fearing we are caſt-awayes. Now when in this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful darkneſs the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is lifted up, and he ſhews his recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled face, oh how do our affections work towards him! The Prodigal, who came home with a ſad and doubtful mind, when he found himſelf in his Fathers armes, when he ſaw tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo long abſence and great exorbitancies had not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd his Fathers love, ſurely the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his love towards his Father again were beyond expreſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Aſſurance of peace <hi>will fill you with joy and wonder.</hi> You will admire to ſee how the caſe is altered with you, a while ago you were ſtrangers, now friends and favourites; a while ago you had not obtained mercy, but now you
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43094:88"/> have obtained mercy; a while ago dead in ſin, but now you have attained to the firſt reſurrection, and ſo are ſome of thoſe happy ones, over whom the ſecond death hath no power; a while ago the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, and ſons of death, now adopted the children of God, and the heirs of glory! Well may your hearts rejoyce, and your joy no man taketh from you. This joy is not like that of the carnal and ungodly, 'tis built upon a ſurer foundation, affliction cannot damp it, and the thoughts of death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which quite ſpoil the mirth of the wicked, will but highten and increaſe it, it being an earneſt of that fulneſs of joy, which after diſſolution will be entred into.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Aſſurance of peace <hi>will mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you unto thankfulneſs.</hi> This is one reaſon certainly, why <hi>David</hi> is called a man after the heart of God, becauſe he was ſo much in praiſe. And aſſurance will make you abound in thankſgiving. Unbelieving doubts and fears cauſe us to be poſſeſſed with a dumb devil, ſo that though our receipts are vaſt, our returns are ſmall: We miſconſtrue mercies, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43094:89"/> ſay, they are common to hypocrites, and that they are given in anger to us, and will ſerve only to increaſe both our ſin and puniſhment. But when we know that our peace is made, we ſhall alſo know our intereſt in thoſe bleſſings which are peculiar to Gods choſen ones; and as for outward mercies, they will be very much ſweetned, becauſe coming not only from the hand, but from the heart of God; and hereupon we ſhall be the more forward <hi>to offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name,</hi> Heb. 13. 15.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Aſſurance of peace <hi>will quicken you to duty, and make you ſtedfaſt in obedience.</hi> With what forwardneſs will you pray, when you know you ſhall be heard? with what willingneſs will you engage in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances, when you know that God will meet with you in them? When you attend upon the miniſtry of the Word, the Lord himſelf hath engaged to be your inſtructer; when you come to the table, he will certainly make you welcome, and will be, not only the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the feaſt likewiſe. Your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43094:89"/> may be juſtly raiſed, and you ſhall not be aſhamed of them. What encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement doth this afford? Add alſo, when you know that you are reconciled to God, and have had a ſight and taſte how good and gracious he is, you will cleave to him with the fuller purpoſe of heart; you will find ſo much ſweetneſs in him, that all the delights of ſin and the world, which Satan doth ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in his temptations, will be but cheap and mean in compariſon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Aſſurance of peace <hi>will ſet you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the fears of affliction and of death:</hi> Then you will be able to make applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſupporting truth unto your ſelves, <hi>That all chaſtiſements are from love, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Of Direction, how peace may be kept and maintained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Let not your hearts be lifted up with pride after the Lord hath manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to you.</hi> Pride is a great enemy to peace. God revives and comforts the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the humble, and the heart of the contrite ones, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 15. Thoſe who obſerve the workings of their own ſouls, ſhall find, after Gods manifeſting himſelf, that pride is commonly one of the firſt ſins which aſſaults them. The Apoſtle, after the abundance of revelations, was in great danger of being exalted above meaſure; therefore the meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is ſent to buffet him, that this ſelf-exalting might be prevented. Oh do not think highly of your ſelves, do not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and undervalue others; the more low you are in your own eyes, your joy and peace will be the more abiding.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be watchful even againſt little ſins:</hi> Theſe will dead the heart, and grieve the Spirit, cauſing him to ſuſpend his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43094:90"/> ſweet influences, and make way for greater. Little ſins have their peculiar aggravations. How inexcuſable are we when we ſtand with God about a ſmall matter, and refuſe to do a little for him? Miſpence of a little time, a little exceſs in uſing of the creatures, a little frothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, the ſmaller ſtirrings of pride and paſſion, and ſuch like, which are more commonly to be found in profeſſors; you muſt beware of, elſe theſe leſſer ſins, to your coſt and ſorrow, will be found great enough, to interrupt and break your peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Eſpecially take heed of groſs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions which waſte the Conſcience.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> would needs feed upon forbidden pleaſures, he loſt his peace, and the joy of Gods ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. Groſſer falls do break the bones, and raiſe a new ſtorm in the Conſcience, where before a calm was. By theſe you will not only cauſe the Lords enemies to reproach <hi>religion,</hi> but alſo your own hearts to reproach <hi>you.</hi> Oh therefore cry, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phold me continually with thy free Spirit,</hi> and <hi>keep back thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:43094:91"/> 4. <hi>Do the work of the Lord diligently.</hi> God doth moſt conſtantly manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe, who moſt conſtantly ſeek and ſearch for him with their whole heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 13. Never offer unto God a ſacrifice, but let it have <hi>ſound inwards.</hi> The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That the Lords countenance doth behold the upright,</hi> Pſal. 11. <hi>ult.</hi> When we are ſincere, and ſerve him with our whole ſoul, then he ſhews his face, and in his looks we may read his love, and through Chriſt his accepting of us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Let your deſign in begging the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of peace be this, that hereby you may be encouraged to do more for God, and to cleave the cloſer to him.</hi> Aim at his glory as well as your own ſatisfaction in this matter. <hi>Lord! I deſire a continued aſſurance of thy love, but 'tis that I may love thee more, and be more zealous for thine honour, and labour in thy work with greater life and vigour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Let it be your dayly practiſe to walk with God.</hi> Be not religious only by fits, this argues an heart much diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:43094:91"/>
            <p> Here I ſhall give a directory how to walk every day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When your eyes are firſt open, lift them up to God, let your hearts be well ſeaſoned with holy thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they will be in the better frame all the day:</p>
            <p n="2">2. Allot ſome time for ſecret prayer and ſearching of the Scripture, twice every day at leaſt: And ſervants, which are not maſters of their own time, if they cannot ſo conveniently pray at one time, ſhould be ſure to catch hold of another opportunity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let not meditation be omitted. One quarter of an hour, at leaſt, in thinking upon ſome truth, the hearing or reading of which hath a little moved you, or which doth moſt concern you, may be well ſpared.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be ſerious in family duties, walk in in the houſe with a perfect heart, and conſcienciouſly do the duties of your places and relations, becauſe the word ſtands much upon theſe, and hereby Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is adorned.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Accuſtom your ſelves to thoughts of God, and let your deſires be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43094:92"/> aſcending towards him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In worldly buſineſs, remember Conſcience is to be kept void of offence; take heed of injuſtice, defrauding, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let not the world, when it flows into your hands, inſinuate it ſelf into your hearts.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Study to excell in thoſe things which may make Religion amiable in the eyes of the world, as meekneſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, contentedneſs with your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, charitableneſs, quietneſs, refuſing to backbite and defame any.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Be vigilant againſt the ſin which doth moſt eaſily beſet you, the ſin of your conſtitution, the ſin of your calling, the ſin which heretofore did bear the greateſt ſway in you.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Reſiſt temptation at the firſt appearing of it; ſtart back from Satans baits, as one would do who is ready to tread upon a Serpent.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Let not Chriſtian liberty degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into carnal licentiouſneſs, uſe not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for an occaſion to the fleſh; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you are the Diſciples of the crucified Jeſus, and ſo in your walking there muſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43094:92"/> be not an enmity, but a ſutableneſs to his Croſs.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Bad company abſtain from, and be not intimate with lukewarm profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; when neceſſitated to be with them, be jealous over your ſelves; never ſinfully comply with, but rather reprove them.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Deſign to get ground upon ſome ſin or other every day; every day let ſome progreſs be made in the work of mortification.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Obſerve providences, and get the good of them; let loſſes and croſſes wean you from the world, let afflictions imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin, and let mercies indear the Father of them.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Reſt not in Ordinances, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider you muſt be reckoned with how you have improved them; If in theſe you neither <hi>meet</hi> with God, nor <hi>miſs</hi> him, 'tis a bad ſign.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Keep a watch before the door of your lips; oaths, falſhood, vanity, filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, your communication muſt be free from. Be alſo ſwift to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak, for in multitude of words there wanteth not ſin.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:43094:93"/> 17. If you fall, lye not where you are fallen, cry immediately for pardon and healing; let the wound, while green, be cured before it feſter.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Have daily recourſe to Chriſt, to cover the ſins of daily incurſion; you have as much need of daily pardon, as you have of dayly bread.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Live as Strangers and Pilgrims; look upon the World as your Inn, and Heaven as your Home, and act as within view of Death, and Judgment, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="20">20. At evening reflect how you have ſpent the day. An Heathen of old gave this notable advice,</p>
            <l>
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Which may be thus Engliſhed.</p>
            <l>Never let ſleep, which ſenſes tyes,</l>
            <l>At any night cloſe up thine eyes,</l>
            <l>Before the actions of the day</l>
            <l>Thou thrice and ſeriouſly doeſt weigh;</l>
            <l>Where have I ſinn'd? what have I done?</l>
            <l>What duty have I let alone?</l>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:43094:93"/>
            <p> If you would walk after this manner, how perfect might your peace be? and how much might your paſſage be ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through this vale of tears?</p>
            <p>I have done with the third Doctrine: I ſhall be very brief in the two which remain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The fourth Doctrine is this, <hi>That when ſinners will not ſee, they are ſmitten many times with ſpiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the things of their peace are in a way of judgment hid from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord hides the things of their peace from them ſeveral wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He cauſes his Spirit to withdraw:</hi> 'Tis the Spirits work to enlighten dark underſtandings; but if the Spirit be gone, how great muſt the darkneſs be?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord gives men up to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe reaſonings and counſels of their own hearts;</hi> and then a thouſand abſurdities will, by the carnal mind, be imagined in the doctrine which is according to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and how burthenſome will the practiſe of godlineſs be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:43094:94"/> 3. <hi>The Lord permits Satan to blind them;</hi> and by his means their hatred of light, and of the works of light, is very much augmented; and hereupon, either more abominable prophaneneſs, or ſtrong deluſions follow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Lord in his providence cauſes ſeveral things to happen,</hi> which ſinners ſtumble at, and by which they are more confirmed in their prejudices againſt the Word, and in their infidelity. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are ſuffer'd ſometimes to fall into ſin, and many times into great diſtreſs: The wicked often proſper in the world, and live and dye in a falſe peace: And upon this the ungodly are more darkned and hardned.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In all this the Lord acts as a Judge, and intends to puniſh their refuſing to be enlightned, and yet he is not the Author of ſin: <hi>He is light,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. and no darkneſs can come from him. All igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and miſtake is from corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being wrought upon by the Prince of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Neither is the juſtice of God to be quarrelled at for dealing thus with them that reject illumination.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:43094:94"/> 1. The merit of their ſin is great. <hi>Neſcire eſt ignorantis, nolle ſcire eſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae;</hi> there is abundance of pride in them that are unwilling to be informed, and a great love to evil deeds, and alſo mighty ingratitude, for light is a very great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This puniſhment is very ſutable; What more equal, then that thoſe, who would not be enlightned by the Spirit of the Lord, and directed into the paths of peace, ſhould be ſuffered to be beguiled by Satan and their own ſpirits, and ſo be miſguided and loſt for ever?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Take heed of ſinning againſt the light, for fear it be put out in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The clearer the light ſhines, the more it aggravates the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let not the luſts of your hearts be cheriſhed and fulfilled, leſt the light of your heads be hereby extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Do not unwarrantably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the things of your peace are in judgment hid from you. All blindneſs is not judicial. If thou wouldſt fain know the will of God and do it, God upon thy <hi>asking will give wiſdom libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally without upbraiding, Jam.</hi> 1. He
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43094:95"/> will not fail by his Spirit to inſtruct thee, who hath made thee thus willing to be inſtructed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The laſt Doctrine follows, <hi>When ſouls are left under darkneſs, their ſtate is wretched and deplorable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider, with ſuch</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God is extreamly angry.</hi> When he puniſheth ſin with ſin he is moſt of all diſpleaſed; and truly he cannot puniſh it with a worſe evil then it ſelf is. In temporal judgments, 'tis to be hoped, the Lord aims at our reformation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; but when he gives up any to blindneſs of mind, and a reprobate ſenſe, 'tis a ſign his love and mercy have done with them. As by the Spirit of God believers are ſealed up to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſo by the ſpirit of flumber the unbelievers are ſealed up to the day of deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With ſuch Satan doth what he pleaſes; he leads them along, and how little do they perceive whither they are going? how do means make them worſe? how bold are they in ſin? how quickly are they like to fill up the meaſure of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43094:95"/> their iniquity, and grow rotten ripe for vengeance? and when that vengeance overtakes them, then they will weep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves, as Chriſt doth over <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and too late lament their own miſery, when 'twill be impoſſible to have it removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Earneſtly intreat, that this may never be yours, which was the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And if you would not lye under the like plague, you muſt not be guilty of the like ſin, namely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Chriſt, and the Goſpel of peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Pitty thoſe who tread in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems</hi> ſteps, and provoke the Lord to cloſe their eyes; tell them of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which they themſelves do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; awaken them out of their Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, if it be poſſible, before it become paſt remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. If the Lord, when others are blinded, is become both light and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any of you, break out into praiſe. The light is marvellous which you are called to, and marvellous ſhould be your joy. You have that eye-ſalve, with which few eyes are annointed, you have that Spirit which the world doth not receive.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43094:96"/> You were born blind as well as others, but a miracle of grace hath been wrought upon you; the vail is taken off, and you ſee the Lord, and your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, how ſhould all that is within you bleſs him? This preſent light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are viſited, is, as it were the dawning of the day of glory, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain forerunner of the light that's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
